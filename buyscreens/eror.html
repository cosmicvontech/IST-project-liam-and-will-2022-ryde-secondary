    <p> purchasing a copy of this movie has not yet been implemented as I'm too lazy to deal with the copyright of it, so in compliance with Copyright Act 1968 we can't distrubute copies, sell, or commercially distrubute of a copy of this movie as it would become an infringing copy. so I personally belive that i should just leave this unable to buy for now </p>
