1
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.519
Here I come!

2
00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.354
Here I come.

3
00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:51.556
Mrs Faulkner?

4
00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.492
Yes. Bella Faulkner.

5
00:02:54.575 --> 00:02:58.896
Bella, Paula Hall from Child Welfare
Services. This is Ricky Baker.

6
00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.399
Ricky Baker. Yes.

7
00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:05.169
Oh, here you are.

8
00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:08.039
Mm.

9
00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:12.977
Ricky, I'm Bella. Uh, you can call
me Bella, or Auntie, if you like,

10
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.212
even though I'm not your real auntie.

11
00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:17.548
But, you know, it's
a bit less formal.

12
00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:19.584
Whoo. You're a big fella!

13
00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:24.455
Who ate the guy who
ate all the pies, eh?

14
00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:26.491
Sorry.

15
00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:28.676
Well, he's nice.

16
00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.862
Yeah. Now, uh, obviously we've got a
couple of things to talk through, Bella.

17
00:03:30.945 --> 00:03:35.466
Clearly you've been briefed about his, uh,
background and also his foster care history.

18
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.136
Apparently he's a bit of
a handful, a real bad egg.

19
00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.538
I mean, if you look at his file,
you'll see that for yourself.

20
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:44.675
We're talking disobedience,
stealing, spitting, running away,

21
00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:50.248
throwing rocks, kicking stuff, defacing
stuff, burning stuff, loitering and graffiti.

22
00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:52.150
And that's just the
stuff we know about.

23
00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:56.787
But hopefully, uh, change in scene
will help straighten him out.

24
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.389
He's home now. He'll be OK.

25
00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:04.209
OK. Well, I like your
enthusiasm. Good.

26
00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:16.974
Ricky, this is your new home.

27
00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:18.776
A real piece of work, this one.

28
00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.345
Ricky!

29
00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.048
There's no one else
who wants you, OK?

30
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:29.687
Now, Ricky, you know what the
alternative is, don't you? Eh?

31
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.007
Think you can make it work?
'Course we can. We'll make it work.

32
00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:46.103
Move. Move it. Move!

33
00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:47.872
Yeah. I've been in
this game a long time.

34
00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:51.876
"No child left behind" is our motto. Well,
it's not, you know, the official motto,

35
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.394
but it's definitely mine.

36
00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:56.914
Also, as part of the transition process,
I'll be needing to inspect your property,

37
00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:59.650
just to make sure that it's
up to our high standard.

38
00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:03.221
Looks fine. What do you think,
Constable Tappert?

39
00:05:03.304 --> 00:05:06.790
Andy!
Yeah, it looks cool.

40
00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:10.361
Yeah. We'll be coming in every eight
weeks or so, just to check in on, uh...

41
00:05:14.515 --> 00:05:16.634
Who's that Crocodile Dundee
guy over there?

42
00:05:16.717 --> 00:05:19.003
Oh, that's my husband, Hector.

43
00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:22.707
Whoa. He's giving
that pig a piggyback.

44
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.982
Well, I see he has a rifle.
Just keep it away from this little guy.

45
00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:33.217
God knows what he's capable of.

46
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.920
OK, he's all yours. No returns.

47
00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:38.872
Oh, I'm just joking.

48
00:05:38.955 --> 00:05:41.826
OK. You've got my number, so just, uh,
ring me if you've got any trouble. OK?

49
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.196
Bye, Ricky.

50
00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.498
Bye, Ricky.

51
00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:49.900
Wow, what a shocker, eh

52
00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:52.503
OK, let's go, Andy.

53
00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:03.080
Ricky, this is Hec. You can
call him Uncle, if you like.

54
00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:06.264
No, he can't.

55
00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:11.122
What do you want to do?
Are you hungry?

56
00:06:11.205 --> 00:06:16.608
That's a silly question,
isn't it? Look at you.

57
00:06:36.363 --> 00:06:38.563
Mm?

58
00:06:43.404 --> 00:06:50.361
You ever worked on a farm before
or you just... ornamental?

59
00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:53.798
Hec. Just remember when we first met,
you weren't much good to anyone.

60
00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:58.336
Just a scruffy white drifter who
smelled like methylated spirits.

61
00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.737
Goodnight.

62
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.873
Eh? What's that, dear?

63
00:07:02.956 --> 00:07:06.243
Goodnight.

64
00:07:06.326 --> 00:07:09.046
Oh...

65
00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.948
Jeez, Hec. You bloody idiot.

66
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:14.051
What?

67
00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:16.921
Ricky?

68
00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:20.024
Buddy? Are you OK?

69
00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:23.928
Sorry about Hec. He's a
silly old goat, that's all.

70
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:27.231
OK, well, I hope you
like your room, petal.

71
00:07:27.314 --> 00:07:29.934
They said you liked to read, so
I got a bunch of books for you,

72
00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:34.739
and you'll also notice an Indian lamp,
a bulldog lamp, and some cats,

73
00:07:34.822 --> 00:07:37.808
and a nice sharp knife to
kill monsters in the night.

74
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:41.078
I can't imagine what you've been through,
boy. You know, I can't imagine it was easy.

75
00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:43.881
But you're here now.
This is home.

76
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:49.320
Anyway, it's really nice to have
you here, and I left a hottie in your bed.

77
00:07:49.403 --> 00:07:51.989
We'll see you in the morning.

78
00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:53.457
OK?

79
00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:56.761
OK, Ricky?

80
00:07:56.844 --> 00:07:58.396
OK.

81
00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:01.613
Nigh-night, then.
See you in the morning.

82
00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:21.712
Jeez, boy, it's a miracle we found you
You made it all of 200m.

83
00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:24.281
I was just taking a break.

84
00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:26.851
Hec's cooking breakfast.

85
00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:34.992
Eggs, bacon, a few sossies
on the side,... pancakes.

86
00:09:35.075 --> 00:09:41.613
Come on. Have some breakfast,
then you can run away.

87
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:53.711
Oh man. I got poop on my kicks.

88
00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:57.729
Go away, insect!

89
00:10:02.936 --> 00:10:07.491
Good pancake.

90
00:10:07.574 --> 00:10:10.561
So, what's your dog's name?

91
00:10:10.644 --> 00:10:11.795
Zag.

92
00:10:11.878 --> 00:10:16.901
You should get another
one and name it Zig.

93
00:10:16.984 --> 00:10:21.205
Bella told me to tell you that...
you should give me something to do.

94
00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:23.340
Is there anything you want me to do?

95
00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:27.692
Yeah,... leave me alone.

96
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.831
Cool.

97
00:11:15.108 --> 00:11:17.377
Morning.

98
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.730
Morning. I thought
you were running away.

99
00:11:19.813 --> 00:11:23.233
I did, but I forgot something,
so I came back.

100
00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:29.807
Oh. Good for you, Ricky.
Good to see some initiative.

101
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.042
You ever been up in
that jungle before?

102
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:37.114
Oh, it's not a jungle; it's the bush. There's
about a million hectares of it, buddy.

103
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.650
You said "bush".

104
00:11:39.733 --> 00:11:43.220
I'm from up there,
deep in the mountains.

105
00:11:43.303 --> 00:11:45.789
You ever go back much?

106
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:48.359
Not for a long time. It's a
hard journey, easy to get lost.

107
00:11:48.442 --> 00:11:51.428
We got a lake up there
called Makutekahu.

108
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:54.064
It's so high up it wets
the cloak of the sky.

109
00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:57.801
It's the first place our spirits
go on their way to Reinga.

110
00:11:57.884 --> 00:12:03.507
Yeah, when my time comes,
that's where I'll go too.

111
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.477
Man, you guys got a lot
of dead stuff round here.

112
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.929
Mm.

113
00:12:09.012 --> 00:12:11.382
Saw a dead sheep the other day.
Had maggots in it.

114
00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:14.184
There's heaps of maggots,

115
00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:17.888
maggots wriggling in that sheep

116
00:12:17.971 --> 00:12:22.626
like moving rice. Yuck.

117
00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:27.064
That was my haiku about maggots.

118
00:12:27.147 --> 00:12:30.501
It's called "Maggots".

119
00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:34.304
This counsellor lady made me
do them when I got in trouble.

120
00:12:34.387 --> 00:12:37.441
They help me express my feelings.

121
00:12:37.524 --> 00:12:40.744
They're poems made up of-
Yeah. I know what a haiku is.

122
00:12:40.827 --> 00:12:44.515
I got heaps of them...
want to hear another one?

123
00:12:44.598 --> 00:12:45.315
Sure.

124
00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:47.951
OK.

125
00:12:48.034 --> 00:12:49.353
"Kingi, you wanker.

126
00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:53.090
"You arsehole.
I hate you heaps.

127
00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:55.926
"Please die soon in pain."

128
00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:58.262
That was called "Kingi, you Wanker".

129
00:12:58.345 --> 00:13:02.399
Yeah, yeah. OK. Got ya. Got ya.
That's enough haikus for today.

130
00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:06.904
Come on. Sit down.
Come and give me a hand.

131
00:13:06.987 --> 00:13:10.207
Well, it's like this,

132
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.677
and then you put it in this bag.

133
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.112
Easy.

134
00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:16.580
Here you go. You have a go.

135
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.152
Do you want to try something else?

136
00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:24.788
Yes, please.

137
00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:30.360
I'm imagining I'm a Maori warrior, and that
bottle over there is a British soldier,

138
00:13:30.443 --> 00:13:33.764
and I'm defending all my wives.

139
00:13:33.847 --> 00:13:35.332
All right, Te Kooti.

140
00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:39.536
Well, you just keep the target
above the little notch in the sight.

141
00:13:39.619 --> 00:13:41.472
And then when you're ready,
you just breathe-

142
00:13:43.857 --> 00:13:45.342
Bloody hell!

143
00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:46.310
So, what are we hunting?

144
00:13:46.393 --> 00:13:50.547
Oh, anything.
Deer, if we're lucky.

145
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.182
Can we shoot one of
those horses up there?

146
00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:55.185
Oh, I'll give- I'll give you
one guess what my answer will be.

147
00:13:55.268 --> 00:13:57.421
Well, can I ride one?

148
00:13:57.504 --> 00:14:00.691
Nobody can ride them;
they're too wild.

149
00:14:00.774 --> 00:14:02.559
Why do they need
to be ridden, anyway?

150
00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:05.395
Well, that's what they're there for.

151
00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:08.232
Why can't they just eat grass and
be horses and leave it at that, eh?

152
00:14:08.315 --> 00:14:10.367
OK, OK. I was just
making conversation.

153
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.535
Shh.

154
00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:15.072
Pig! Come on!

155
00:14:15.155 --> 00:14:17.141
What?

156
00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:25.129
,

157
00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:48.038
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
That's dinner sorted!

158
00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:50.374
Whoa! Want to help me gut it?

159
00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:58.515
# Ricky Baker, now
you are 13 years old.

160
00:14:58.598 --> 00:15:03.053
# You are a teenager,
and you're as good as gold.

161
00:15:03.136 --> 00:15:04.421
# Ricky Baker-

162
00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:06.806
Oh.

163
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:09.193
<font color="#D900D9"># Ricky Baker, happy birthday.

164
00:15:09.276 --> 00:15:13.263
# Once rejected, now accepted

165
00:15:13.346 --> 00:15:17.401
# by me and Hector.

166
00:15:17.484 --> 00:15:20.604
# We're a trifecta.

167
00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:23.440
# Ricky Baker,
ah, Ricky Baker,

168
00:15:23.523 --> 00:15:25.442
# ah, Ricky Baker,

00:15:40.407 --> 00:15:41.225
Hip hip!

173
00:15:41.308 --> 00:15:43.627
Hooray!

174
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.395
Go on, blow out your candles.

175
00:15:45.478 --> 00:15:48.079
OK.

176
00:15:52.752 --> 00:15:58.656
Hector, do you think it's time
we gave Ricky his present?

177
00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:11.421
Thank you, Auntie!
Thank you, Uncle!

178
00:16:13.489 --> 00:16:15.392
Feed him, clean up after him.
He's yours- you're responsible.

179
00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:19.062
This is the best
birthday I've ever had.

180
00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:22.165
I think it's the only
birthday I've ever had.

181
00:16:26.286 --> 00:16:28.888
What are you gonna call him?

182
00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:31.575
Um, still thinking. Something
fierce to reflect its true nature.

183
00:16:31.658 --> 00:16:36.413
Either Psycho, Megatron...
or Tupac.

184
00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:39.599
What's a Tupac?

185
00:16:39.682 --> 00:16:42.867
It's just my- this really cool rapper,
and he's, like, my best friend.

186
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.990
Are you gonna run away tonight?

187
00:16:47.073 --> 00:16:48.258
Not sure.

188
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:50.260
No, oh, it's cool with me.

189
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:54.164
Just make sure you're
back by breakfast.

190
00:16:54.247 --> 00:16:55.699
OK.

191
00:16:55.782 --> 00:16:58.502
So happy we found you, buddy.

192
00:16:58.585 --> 00:17:01.271
Sorry it took so long.

193
00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.173
Me too.

194
00:17:05.692 --> 00:17:07.077
Nigh-night, Ricky.

195
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:13.016
Night, Auntie.

196
00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:49.953
Where are you going, Tupac?

197
00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:52.356
Come on.

198
00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:53.457
Man!

199
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.360
Ohhh!

200
00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:58.362
Oh, Bella!

201
00:18:23.803 --> 00:18:27.657
You know, sometimes in life,

202
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.361
it seems like there's no way out-

203
00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:37.768
like a sheep trapped in
a maze designed by wolves.

204
00:18:37.851 --> 00:18:40.070
And you know that if
you're ever in that situation,

205
00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:43.206
there are always
two doors to choose from.

206
00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.876
And through the first door- oh,
it's easy to get through that door-

207
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:50.080
and on the other side waiting for you are
all the nummiest treats you can imagine-

208
00:18:50.163 --> 00:18:56.086
Fanta, Doritos, L&P,
Burger Rings, Coke Zero.

209
00:18:56.169 --> 00:19:01.825
But you know what? There's also another door,
not the Burger Ring door, not the Fanta door;

210
00:19:01.908 --> 00:19:04.928
another door that's
harder to get through.

211
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:11.382
Guess what's on the other side?
Anyone want to take a guess?

212
00:19:12.385 --> 00:19:15.539
Vegetables?

213
00:19:15.622 --> 00:19:19.676
N-No, not vegeta-

214
00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:21.311
No.

215
00:19:21.394 --> 00:19:24.480
Jesus?

216
00:19:24.563 --> 00:19:27.651
You would think Jesus. I thought Jesus the
first time I-I-I-I came across that door.

217
00:19:27.734 --> 00:19:30.353
It's not Jesus.
It's another door.

218
00:19:30.436 --> 00:19:36.626
And guess what's on the
other side of that door?

219
00:19:36.709 --> 00:19:37.661
Jesus.

220
00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:39.563
Jesus. Yeah, Jesus.

221
00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:42.666
He's tricky like that, Jesus.

222
00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:45.335
So let us pray, to Jesus, please,

223
00:19:45.418 --> 00:19:49.172
and make it a bit easier to get
through those doors, uh, to find you

224
00:19:49.255 --> 00:19:53.710
and your bounty of
delicious confectionary.

225
00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:56.880
Thank you, Selena.
Take it away.

226
00:21:14.774 --> 00:21:18.309
Dinner. It's a bit burnt.

227
00:21:25.385 --> 00:21:29.139
Here.

228
00:21:29.222 --> 00:21:31.474
Read this.

229
00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:35.178
Out loud.

230
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:38.415
"From the
Child Welfare people.

231
00:21:38.498 --> 00:21:40.433
"Mr Hector Faulkner.

232
00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:42.452
"This is Paula Hall from
Child Welfare writing to you.

233
00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:44.621
"I'm sorry to hear about
your recent bereavement.

234
00:21:44.704 --> 00:21:47.257
"However, in light of
the altered circumstances,

235
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.294
"the current situation regarding
Ricky's care will have to be reviewed.

236
00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:55.365
"As of June the 1st, I will be
taking him back into state custody

237
00:21:55.448 --> 00:21:57.767
"until alternative
arrangements can be made.

238
00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.504
"Rest assured I am working tireless
to find a new home for Ricky.

239
00:22:01.587 --> 00:22:06.309
"And you can expect a visit next
week for Ricky's collection.

240
00:22:06.392 --> 00:22:12.115
"Sincerely, Paula Hall,
Ministry of Child Welfare."

241
00:22:12.198 --> 00:22:14.818
Like hell! They can't do that!

242
00:22:14.901 --> 00:22:16.419
Yeah, they can.

243
00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.089
But I live here now.
It's my home!

244
00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:24.894
Not any more, it isn't. Not in their
eyes. Not without a woman to run the show.

245
00:22:28.864 --> 00:22:32.669
Why don't we just get you a new wife? There's
plenty of ladies on the internet, I heard.

246
00:22:32.752 --> 00:22:34.453
Too soon?

247
00:22:34.536 --> 00:22:36.239
What if we just keep living here,
and if they try to take the farm,

248
00:22:36.322 --> 00:22:38.908
we'll just have a
shootout, like Scarface.

249
00:22:38.991 --> 00:22:40.677
Except we don't have any cocaine.

250
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.862
You can't change this, Ricky.

251
00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:45.048
You're gonna go back, and you're
gonna stick it out in a new home. OK?

252
00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:47.183
There's no way that's happening.

253
00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:50.854
Well, I'm gonna go bush. I'm
gonna... disappear for a while.

254
00:22:50.937 --> 00:22:56.693
Disappear? Yeah,
that sounds more like me.

255
00:22:56.776 --> 00:22:58.228
Come on! We'll be a team!

256
00:22:58.311 --> 00:23:01.798
Oh, for God's sake. You wouldn't
last five minutes out there.

257
00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:06.336
But Auntie Bella said
you had to look after me!

258
00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:08.571
Can you just give me some privacy?

259
00:23:22.135 --> 00:23:24.621
I heard they do experiments
at the Boys' Home-

260
00:23:24.704 --> 00:23:27.023
waterboarding, torture,
that sort of thing.

261
00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:33.196
This one boy got thrown acid on his
face because he asked for more Weet-Bix.

262
00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:35.732
Hey, you can't put Auntie in a box.

263
00:23:35.815 --> 00:23:39.691
Give it a rest.

264
00:23:39.774 --> 00:23:43.650
But she wanted to go
to the sky place.

265
00:23:43.733 --> 00:23:47.610
She's gone, OK? That's life- one day you're
here, and the next you're in a bloody box.

266
00:23:47.693 --> 00:23:54.217
Just get this into your head, boy- it
was Bella that wanted you here, not me.

267
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.002
I know you think this
can work, but it can't.

268
00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:06.510
So the welfare people are coming
on Friday. They're coming to get you.

269
00:24:07.146 --> 00:24:08.765
That's that, then?

270
00:24:08.848 --> 00:24:13.083
Yep... that's that.

271
00:24:38.611 --> 00:24:41.831
That's that.

272
00:25:11.911 --> 00:25:14.645
Goodbye, Ricky Baker.

273
00:25:19.218 --> 00:25:20.937
FLAMES WHOOSH Uh-oh.

274
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:25.656
Come on, Tupac! Come on, Tupac!

275
00:26:01.961 --> 00:26:07.584
# Out alone in the middle
of the ocean blue.

276
00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:09.686
Whoa!

277
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:16.493
# Leave the world behind I
guess I never really knew.

278
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:24.148
# So many people, so many worlds.

279
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:30.621
# Don't you worry about me.

280
00:26:32.858 --> 00:26:36.161
# Don't you worry about...

281
00:26:36.244 --> 00:26:39.629
Five down, 10 to go. Come on,
Ricky. Stick on the rations.

282
00:26:55.915 --> 00:27:03.706
# I belong in the middle
of the ocean blue.

283
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:10.980
# I'm getting nowhere, but that
shouldn't really bother you.

284
00:27:11.063 --> 00:27:19.088
Stuff this,
Tupac. We're going home.

285
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:24.608
# Don't you worry about me. #

286
00:27:39.258 --> 00:27:40.276
Are you lost?

287
00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:42.445
Oh!

288
00:27:42.528 --> 00:27:43.279
No.

289
00:27:43.362 --> 00:27:44.881
Yeah, you are.

290
00:27:44.964 --> 00:27:47.116
Told you you wouldn't last more
than five minutes out here.

291
00:27:49.417 --> 00:27:51.554
You got yourself very lost.
I'm amazed how lost you got.

292
00:27:51.637 --> 00:27:55.058
I move fast. I've got my
own thing going on here-

293
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:57.694
Ricky Town.
Population- Ricky.

294
00:27:57.777 --> 00:28:00.263
Yeah, well. You're going
back to Reality Town.

295
00:28:00.346 --> 00:28:02.765
Like hell. I live here now.

296
00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:04.334
Like hell.

297
00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:05.902
I've got better things to do
than to run around the bush

298
00:28:05.985 --> 00:28:07.937
looking for little
shits like you. So get up.

299
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.905
I hate you.

300
00:28:08.988 --> 00:28:10.139
Well, I hate you too.

301
00:28:10.222 --> 00:28:11.507
I hope you die.

302
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.059
Me too!

303
00:28:14.142 --> 00:28:16.613
You may as well just kill me now.

304
00:28:16.696 --> 00:28:20.483
Don't kill me.

305
00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:23.686
Anyway, I'm excited
to go back to the city.

306
00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:26.805
Good.

307
00:28:26.888 --> 00:28:29.926
Can't wait. I hate it here-
so much dirt.

308
00:28:30.009 --> 00:28:33.696
It's going to be cool.

309
00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:37.467
Get me some new gears, become a drug
dealer, a rapper, and die in a drive-by.

310
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.603
Just keep an eye on
where you're going.

311
00:28:44.323 --> 00:28:46.576
This is wet.

312
00:28:46.659 --> 00:28:49.912
I'm hungry. Where are we?

313
00:28:49.995 --> 00:28:51.147
Shut it.

314
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.982
I hate the bush.

315
00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:55.818
Shut it.

316
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.820
My shoes are wet.

317
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:01.824
You're the useless bugger who got lost
in the first place. You remember that.

318
00:29:01.907 --> 00:29:03.860
You don't even have a map.
Where's our map?

319
00:29:03.943 --> 00:29:07.397
Don't need one.
I know where I am.

320
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.199
Probably couldn't
even read it anyway.

321
00:29:10.282 --> 00:29:11.934
Why would I need to read a map?

322
00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:16.005
I already told you- I know where I am.
Reading is stupid anyway.

323
00:29:16.088 --> 00:29:24.147
Only people who can't read
say things like that.

324
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.481
What?

325
00:29:25.564 --> 00:29:29.118
No. You can't read?!

326
00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:31.703
Watch it, pal.

327
00:29:31.786 --> 00:29:34.290
You're like one of those people who are, like,
raised by, like, wolves or something, eh?

328
00:29:34.373 --> 00:29:36.359
Ooga booga! Me Hec- me no read!

329
00:29:38.593 --> 00:29:40.663
What's this? This is words.
Me stupid.

330
00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:41.371
You little bast-

331
00:29:46.919 --> 00:29:47.937
Ah, my foot.

332
00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.089
You OK?

333
00:29:51.172 --> 00:29:54.243
No. I'm not OK. This is all your fault,
you little bastard!

334
00:29:54.326 --> 00:29:57.594
Come on, let's get you comfortable.

335
00:30:12.912 --> 00:30:14.363
I don't really think
you're a bastard.

336
00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:19.001
Yeah, you do. That's OK,
because I think you're a bastard too.

337
00:30:19.084 --> 00:30:25.341
Anyway, it's good. It's...
healthy to get these feelings out.

338
00:30:25.424 --> 00:30:26.576
Can you move it yet?

339
00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:30.713
'Course I can't. It's fractured.
Take weeks to heal.

340
00:30:30.796 --> 00:30:34.183
OK, Debbie Downer, can we think
of something more positive?

341
00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:38.254
Maybe you could... write a
haiku to express your feelings.

342
00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:42.458
A what?

343
00:30:42.541 --> 00:30:45.661
Lost in the forest.

344
00:30:45.744 --> 00:30:49.599
A sore ankle, poor uncle.

345
00:30:49.682 --> 00:30:52.702
Oh well, never mind.

346
00:30:52.785 --> 00:30:55.104
Oh God, we really need
to get out of here.

347
00:30:55.187 --> 00:30:58.374
Do you want me to go find help?

348
00:30:58.457 --> 00:30:59.709
I'd die, wouldn't I?

349
00:30:59.792 --> 00:31:02.445
No, we've got no choice but to
camp out here for a few weeks.

350
00:31:02.528 --> 00:31:03.880
But I'm hungry!

351
00:31:03.963 --> 00:31:06.648
There's plenty to eat
if you know where to look.

352
00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:09.418
Well, I don't know where to look, Hector.
And also, I ran out of toilet paper.

353
00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:10.720
Give me some of yours.

354
00:31:10.803 --> 00:31:12.938
Eh?

355
00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:15.158
I've gotta poop. I need a poop,
you need a poop. We all poop.

356
00:31:15.241 --> 00:31:17.093
Use a leaf.

357
00:31:17.176 --> 00:31:18.227
A leaf?

358
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.130
I hate you.

359
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:22.131
And bury it!

360
00:31:22.214 --> 00:31:24.948
I'll bury you.

361
00:31:29.788 --> 00:31:33.042
This ain't no charred foster kid.

362
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:34.811
How can you tell, Paula?

363
00:31:34.894 --> 00:31:39.115
Does this look like a
human head to you, Andy?

364
00:31:43.168 --> 00:31:45.704
Where are you, Ricky Baker?

365
00:31:45.787 --> 00:31:48.324
Hey, I reckon the old man chopped
him up, buried him somewhere-

366
00:31:50.476 --> 00:31:52.094
Or ate him.

367
00:31:52.177 --> 00:31:55.731
Something definitely happened,
but I'm wondering what.

368
00:31:55.814 --> 00:32:01.504
OK, I'm gonna need you to shut up, Andy,
because you're doing my frickin' head in.

369
00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:03.306
Come on, let's go.

370
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:05.942
This ain't over by a Mangaweka mile.

371
00:32:06.025 --> 00:32:07.643
Get me the police.
It's an emergency.

372
00:32:07.726 --> 00:32:09.412
Hey, whoa, Paula.
I am the police.

373
00:32:09.495 --> 00:32:12.930
I mean real ones, Andy.
Ones with guns.

374
00:32:25.477 --> 00:32:28.512
# Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Yeah.

375
00:32:51.537 --> 00:32:55.291
Hey, Uncle, wanna
listen to my Walkman?

376
00:32:55.374 --> 00:32:57.360
No.

377
00:33:00.245 --> 00:33:01.097
Where are you going?

378
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:01.964
Hunting.

379
00:33:02.047 --> 00:33:05.167
Like hell.

380
00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.435
You can thank me later.

381
00:33:06.518 --> 00:33:07.403
Tupac!

382
00:33:07.486 --> 00:33:11.688
TUPAC BARKS Yeah, yeah.

383
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:57.820
Did you get any food?

384
00:33:57.903 --> 00:33:59.989
What the hell is that?

385
00:34:00.072 --> 00:34:02.959
Salad.

386
00:34:03.042 --> 00:34:08.045
What? I'd like to see
you do any better.

387
00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:19.375
Never eaten a slug before.
Where did you get it?

388
00:34:19.458 --> 00:34:22.545
It's an eel.
Got it down the creek.

389
00:34:22.628 --> 00:34:24.647
Yeah, but how? With what?

390
00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.883
Oh, I don't know. The knack.

391
00:34:27.966 --> 00:34:31.887
Oh yeah, the knack.
What's that? How do you get it?

392
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:35.157
It's not a thing. It's just-

393
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.660
You just get it. It's a...

394
00:34:37.743 --> 00:34:39.428
Oh, it's a way of, um-

395
00:34:39.511 --> 00:34:43.632
it's a way of figuring things out
without having to think too hard or...

396
00:34:43.715 --> 00:34:47.269
or talk, more importantly.

397
00:34:47.352 --> 00:34:51.540
You know, most people who die in
the bush- they're found naked.

398
00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:53.291
Ew.

399
00:34:53.374 --> 00:34:55.044
Yeah, they panic, and they think
their clothes are slowing them down.

400
00:34:55.127 --> 00:34:58.414
They throw them away, and
then the cold gets to them.

401
00:34:58.497 --> 00:35:02.018
But the trick is-
this is the knack-

402
00:35:02.101 --> 00:35:05.755
you stay calm, you look for water,
you follow it to high ground

403
00:35:05.838 --> 00:35:10.126
until you can see what's going on.

404
00:35:10.209 --> 00:35:15.297
What would you do if I got
lost today? Would you miss me?

405
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:20.984
Well, you- you didn't get lost,
so... that's good.

406
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.939
Do you miss Auntie Bella?

407
00:35:24.022 --> 00:35:25.775
Shh.

408
00:35:25.858 --> 00:35:30.312
Yeah, you're still processing.

409
00:35:30.395 --> 00:35:34.817
You got to do that when sad
things happen- process it.

410
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.790
That's like when my mate Amber died.
I processed that for ages.

411
00:35:40.873 --> 00:35:43.793
Who's Amber?

412
00:35:43.876 --> 00:35:46.395
We were in a home
together for a while,

413
00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:51.567
and she went to this new family and
then started getting in trouble,

414
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.637
telling stories about the dad.

415
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.541
And then one day she was just dead.

416
00:35:58.624 --> 00:36:01.043
What do you mean dead? How?

417
00:36:01.126 --> 00:36:05.061
Don't know. No one told me.

418
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.939
This slug is actually pretty good.

419
00:36:27.853 --> 00:36:32.789
Come on, it's time
to get out of here.

420
00:36:38.263 --> 00:36:43.252
Yes! Yes! Yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes! Yes!

421
00:36:43.335 --> 00:36:49.191
OK. We'll stay here the night, and we'll
be back at the farm by tomorrow arvo.

422
00:36:49.274 --> 00:36:50.226
Yes!

423
00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:53.195
There's beds, books!

424
00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:56.532
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Toilet paper!

425
00:36:56.615 --> 00:36:58.667
A nice, warm fire.
DOGS BARK Get out, you mongrels.

426
00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:04.073
Come on. Come on. Give me some bars so I
can communicate with the outside world.

427
00:37:04.156 --> 00:37:05.374
Ricky,...

428
00:37:05.457 --> 00:37:08.110
take a look at this.

429
00:37:08.193 --> 00:37:12.081
Oh, Uncle. We're famous!

430
00:37:12.164 --> 00:37:16.218
"Hector Faulkner,
65, and Richard Baker, 13,

431
00:37:16.301 --> 00:37:18.988
"have been missing now for six weeks.

432
00:37:19.071 --> 00:37:22.224
"Faulkner is Cauc...

433
00:37:22.307 --> 00:37:23.692
"Cauc... Asian."

434
00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:26.762
Wow, they got that wrong,
because you're obviously white.

435
00:37:26.845 --> 00:37:32.168
"There is a fear for Faulkner's mental health
following the recent death of his wife.

436
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:35.638
"Police are not ruling
out kidnapping." Kidnapping!

437
00:37:35.721 --> 00:37:38.207
"Park rangers have been alerted
for anyone seeing the pair

438
00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.976
"should report back to the
nearest police station." Ho!

439
00:37:41.059 --> 00:37:48.517
Uncle, you're basically a criminal now.
But on the bright side, you're famous.

440
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.252
They think I'm crazy.

441
00:37:50.335 --> 00:37:53.270
And Asian.

442
00:37:57.743 --> 00:38:01.864
Hey, you know when the Wildebeests
migrate, they walk up to a thousand miles.

443
00:38:01.947 --> 00:38:03.332
Is that heaps?

444
00:38:03.415 --> 00:38:04.867
Yeah. Heaps.

445
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.101
Just like us.

446
00:38:06.184 --> 00:38:10.506
Walking, walking,
trying to get somewhere.

447
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:15.711
Looking for a better home.

448
00:38:15.794 --> 00:38:16.545
Gidday.

449
00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:20.983
Gidday.

450
00:38:21.066 --> 00:38:27.723
Jeez, eh. Whoo. Got a lot of explaining to
do. A lot of people looking for you two.

451
00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:29.825
Yeah, we know.

452
00:38:29.908 --> 00:38:35.178
I did my ankle back in one of the valleys.
And, uh, we're on the way out now.

453
00:38:37.916 --> 00:38:40.970
Well,...

454
00:38:41.053 --> 00:38:43.872
wait till they hear
we caught you in a hut.

455
00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:50.346
Well, we weren't hiding. The boy got himself
lost, and, uh, I'm bringing him back.

456
00:38:50.429 --> 00:38:57.386
Whoa. Cool gun, bro. What do you
guys shoot with this? Sparrows?

457
00:38:57.469 --> 00:39:02.958
Mm, sometimes.

458
00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:04.460
He hurt you, son?

459
00:39:04.543 --> 00:39:07.229
Nah. I fell in some
prickles one time.

460
00:39:07.312 --> 00:39:08.664
Did he push you in those prickles?

461
00:39:08.747 --> 00:39:11.400
Yeah, probably. Did he push
you in the prickles, mate?

462
00:39:11.483 --> 00:39:12.534
Leave him alone.

463
00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:14.837
You shut your trap, old fulla.

464
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.008
I'd go get some rest if I was you.
You've got a long walk tomorrow.

465
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:23.379
First of all, you
watch how you talk to me.

466
00:39:23.462 --> 00:39:24.847
And second of all,

467
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.249
you can take him,
but I'm staying here.

468
00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:29.685
Like hell. People want answers.

469
00:39:29.768 --> 00:39:32.020
Yeah, answers.

470
00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:34.356
Look, we got lost; I got injured.
He's fine. It was basically a holiday.

471
00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:40.362
Not a real holiday,
because he made me do stuff.

472
00:39:40.445 --> 00:39:43.097
Like what?

473
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.834
Just stuff. He had a sore leg,
so he made me do things for him.

474
00:39:45.917 --> 00:39:52.574
It was hard at first, because my hands
are so soft. But I got used to it.

475
00:39:52.657 --> 00:39:58.247
I didn't really want to do it,
but it was the only way to survive.

476
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:02.384
Well, it wasn't always hard.
Sometimes I got to do my own thing.

477
00:40:02.467 --> 00:40:05.154
He pretty much never
joined in with me, though.

478
00:40:05.237 --> 00:40:09.158
I asked if he wanted
to play with me, but...

479
00:40:09.241 --> 00:40:13.562
he would just make
me play with myself.

480
00:40:14.746 --> 00:40:16.532
I feel sick. I feel sick, Hugh.

481
00:40:16.615 --> 00:40:19.101
Well- Hang on. He doesn't
know what he means.

482
00:40:19.184 --> 00:40:21.203
You're a bloody pervert.

483
00:40:21.286 --> 00:40:22.037
What did you call me?

484
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.137
You heard him.

485
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.239
Yeah, you heard him, you old perv.

486
00:40:24.322 --> 00:40:26.709
Hey! He's not a pervert,
you dickhead!

487
00:40:26.792 --> 00:40:27.542
Shut up, Ricky.

488
00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:28.377
Yeah, shut up, Ricky.

489
00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.679
Hey, only I get to
tell him to shut up.

490
00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:35.384
Oooh. Brainwasher.

491
00:40:35.467 --> 00:40:37.986
You're going to jail, you pervert.

492
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:39.988
Want to say that again?

493
00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:41.890
Say it again.

494
00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:44.741
Going to jail,...

495
00:40:47.846 --> 00:40:48.931
you pervert.

496
00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:02.745
Get off, you mongrel!

497
00:41:04.229 --> 00:41:06.382
Shit just got real!

498
00:41:06.465 --> 00:41:08.917
Back up, homies, and
let go of my uncle!

499
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.988
It's OK, kid. You can put it down.
He won't hurt you anymore.

500
00:41:14.372 --> 00:41:17.493
I said get away from my uncle.

501
00:41:17.576 --> 00:41:22.631
Ricky, give me that.

502
00:41:22.714 --> 00:41:24.099
Get down!

503
00:41:24.182 --> 00:41:29.004
Ricky, get their guns. Take the
bolts out. We're getting out of here.

504
00:41:30.722 --> 00:41:35.978
Yeah. Shit just got real.

505
00:41:36.061 --> 00:41:37.212
Hey!

506
00:41:37.295 --> 00:41:38.814
You're dead, old man.

507
00:41:38.897 --> 00:41:43.185
Yeah, dead meat, you old perv!

508
00:41:43.268 --> 00:41:45.287
,

509
00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:50.459
You've had it, mate!
There's no chance for you!

510
00:41:50.542 --> 00:41:53.896
Get up.

511
00:41:55.413 --> 00:41:57.833
Straight up that was the most
gangster shit I've ever done.

512
00:41:57.916 --> 00:42:01.770
You idiot. And what were you talking about
back there? Do you know what that sounds like?

513
00:42:01.853 --> 00:42:04.706
No!

514
00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:05.908
Ohhh!

515
00:42:05.991 --> 00:42:07.042
They're gonna put me away for sure.

516
00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:08.960
Bastards.

517
00:42:09.043 --> 00:42:10.879
Yeah, bastards. Hear what
that guy called me? Pervert!

518
00:42:10.962 --> 00:42:11.880
We need more guns,...

519
00:42:11.963 --> 00:42:12.748
Oh God. What am I gonna do?

520
00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:13.916
... hand grenades,...

521
00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:15.500
Think. I've got to think.

522
00:42:15.583 --> 00:42:17.085
... maybe a rocket launcher.
They're gonna come for us.

523
00:42:17.168 --> 00:42:18.053
Yeah, Police.

524
00:42:18.136 --> 00:42:19.087
Awesome.

525
00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.856
No, it's not awesome,
Ricky, it's serious.

526
00:42:20.939 --> 00:42:23.292
Yeah, but no one got hurt.
You're not dangerous.

527
00:42:23.375 --> 00:42:25.694
Yeah, well, I am to them.

528
00:42:25.777 --> 00:42:26.361
I've been to prison.

529
00:42:26.444 --> 00:42:29.031
Gangster! For what?

530
00:42:29.114 --> 00:42:29.965
Manslaughter.

531
00:42:30.048 --> 00:42:30.899
Double gangster!

532
00:42:30.982 --> 00:42:32.434
You need a teardrop tattoo.

533
00:42:32.517 --> 00:42:35.237
Oh, I was young.
It was a drunken fight.

534
00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.173
Did my time, but...
they won't see it like that.

535
00:42:38.256 --> 00:42:41.242
I'll just tell them you
were looking after me.

536
00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:44.313
It doesn't matter what you tell them; they won't
believe you. They'll think I made you do it.

537
00:42:44.396 --> 00:42:46.682
I'm not going back to jail.
I'm better off up here.

538
00:42:46.765 --> 00:42:49.651
This is no place for a kid.
You're going to have to go back, Ricky.

539
00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:50.419
To what?

540
00:42:50.502 --> 00:42:51.753
Well, to the welfare people.

541
00:42:51.836 --> 00:42:53.088
No.
They'll look after you.

542
00:42:53.171 --> 00:42:55.545
No, they won't.

543
00:42:55.628 --> 00:42:58.002
They'll find you another home.
You'll be fine.

544
00:42:58.085 --> 00:43:00.462
No. You're not listening! Nobody listens.
There's no more homes, just juvie!

545
00:43:00.545 --> 00:43:01.964
What's juvie?

546
00:43:02.047 --> 00:43:05.300
Juvenile prison.

547
00:43:05.383 --> 00:43:07.669
They don't care about kids like me.

548
00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:09.738
They just keep moving
us around until...

549
00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:15.191
something happens, like... Amber.

550
00:43:19.331 --> 00:43:23.452
Oh, no. Bugger that.

551
00:43:23.535 --> 00:43:27.389
OK, OK. We're in about a million
hectares of bush- that's big.

552
00:43:27.472 --> 00:43:29.691
It's big enough to enough to
hide in for a while, anyway.

553
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.859
Good enough for me.

554
00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:34.029
But we're heading into winter. It's gonna be
rough- no huts, no tents, real bush life.

555
00:43:34.112 --> 00:43:34.830
Can you handle that?

556
00:43:34.913 --> 00:43:36.265
I can handle it.

557
00:43:36.348 --> 00:43:39.167
Yeah. And if you play up, I dump ya.

558
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:40.402
OK, Uncle.

559
00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:42.337
I'd still prefer if
you don't call me Uncle.

560
00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:46.742
OK, Hec. So what do we do now?

561
00:43:46.825 --> 00:43:50.045
We run.

562
00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:53.715
Wait, wait, wait.

563
00:43:53.798 --> 00:43:55.350
No, no.

564
00:43:55.433 --> 00:43:56.585
No, we don't need to run.

565
00:43:56.668 --> 00:43:59.988
Oh yeah.
Let's just fast walk.

566
00:44:00.071 --> 00:44:01.957
Yeah. Come on.

567
00:44:13.652 --> 00:44:17.306
# Oh, sinner man,
where you gonna run to?

568
00:44:22.193 --> 00:44:24.846
# Where you gonna run to?

569
00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:26.815
# All on that day.

570
00:44:26.898 --> 00:44:29.217
# Well, I run to the rock.

571
00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.421
# Please hide me, I run to the rock.

572
00:44:32.504 --> 00:44:36.124
# Please hide me, I run to the rock.

573
00:44:36.207 --> 00:44:38.226
# Please hide me, Lord.

574
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:39.828
# All on that day.

575
00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:43.532
# But the rock cried out,
"I can't hide you."

576
00:44:43.615 --> 00:44:46.768
# 'The rock cried out,
"I can't hide you."

577
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:51.807
# The rock cried out, "I
ain't gonna hide you, guy."

578
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:53.408
# All on that day.

579
00:44:53.491 --> 00:44:59.548
# I said, 'Rock! What's
the matter with you, rock?

580
00:44:59.631 --> 00:45:03.251
# "Don't you see I need you, rock?"

581
00:45:03.334 --> 00:45:05.320
# Lord, Lord, Lord.

582
00:45:05.403 --> 00:45:07.623
# All on that day.

583
00:45:07.706 --> 00:45:10.440
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

584
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:16.264
# Oughta be prayin', sinner man.

585
00:45:16.347 --> 00:45:16.999
# Oughta be prayin'.

586
00:45:18.817 --> 00:45:19.635
# All on that day.

587
00:45:19.718 --> 00:45:23.605
# I cried, 'Power!
# Power.

588
00:45:23.688 --> 00:45:27.109
# Power!
# Power, power.

589
00:45:27.192 --> 00:45:30.245
# Power!
# Power, power.

590
00:45:30.328 --> 00:45:33.348
# Power!
# Power, power.

591
00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:36.418
# Power!
# Power, power.

592
00:45:36.501 --> 00:45:40.536
# Power!
# Power, power. #

593
00:46:07.332 --> 00:46:09.751
Pretty majestical, eh?

594
00:46:09.834 --> 00:46:12.254
I don't think that's a word.

595
00:46:12.337 --> 00:46:14.423
Majestical? Sure it is.

596
00:46:14.506 --> 00:46:16.458
Nah, it's not real.

597
00:46:16.541 --> 00:46:18.360
What would you know?

598
00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:20.529
It's "majestic."

599
00:46:20.612 --> 00:46:23.398
Well, that doesn't
sound very special.

600
00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:26.868
"Majestical" is way better.

601
00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:29.604
What do you reckon this
place is called, anyway?

602
00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:34.643
Do you think it's that place where the
cloak gets wet by the sky or something?

603
00:46:34.726 --> 00:46:36.344
I don't know. What the
hell does that mean?

604
00:46:36.427 --> 00:46:38.146
Auntie Bella said she
was from up here-

605
00:46:38.229 --> 00:46:41.450
from this special lake
that almost touches the sky.

606
00:46:41.533 --> 00:46:44.786
Mate, Bella didn't
know where she was from.

607
00:46:44.869 --> 00:46:45.487
Nah, she said-

608
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.155
No. She was making it up.

609
00:46:47.238 --> 00:46:52.694
Look, Bella didn't have any
family. Like you. Like me.

610
00:46:52.777 --> 00:46:56.998
That's why she wanted to look
after you... and took pity on me.

611
00:46:57.081 --> 00:47:02.938
She wanted to save us poor wretches
when no one else wanted us.

612
00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:05.588
Like rescue dogs.

613
00:47:06.958 --> 00:47:11.994
That's the way she was.
Heart of gold.

614
00:47:17.202 --> 00:47:20.937
Yeah, it's majestical.

615
00:47:21.539 --> 00:47:24.926
May as well camp, eh?

616
00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:27.562
Sun is going down.

617
00:47:33.852 --> 00:47:37.539
Developing story now,
more on this massive national manhunt.

618
00:47:37.622 --> 00:47:41.610
Yes, we've got Paula Hall from the
Department of Child Welfare with us.

619
00:47:41.693 --> 00:47:42.878
Paula, thank you for being here...

620
00:47:42.961 --> 00:47:44.846
Good morning.

621
00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:46.815
Tell us about this boy. What kind
of character are we talking about?

622
00:47:46.898 --> 00:47:48.599
Well, look, we're-

623
00:47:48.682 --> 00:47:50.385
We're talking about a young boy
who is capable of stealing,

624
00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:55.257
spitting, breaking stuff,
kicking stuff, defacing stuff,

625
00:47:55.340 --> 00:48:00.595
stealing stuff, burning stuff and,
uh, loitering and graffiti-ing. Yeah.

626
00:48:00.678 --> 00:48:05.433
Mm. Even so, Paula, he's just a kid,
right? He's alone in the bush. He's scared.

627
00:48:05.516 --> 00:48:08.603
Scared? No, no. He's not-
He's not a scared little kid.

628
00:48:08.686 --> 00:48:12.674
He's a spanner in the works, and I'm the
mechanic who is gonna take that spanner

629
00:48:12.757 --> 00:48:15.076
and put him back in the toolbox- OK.

630
00:48:15.159 --> 00:48:19.748
... where he belongs. No child
left behind. No child left behind.

631
00:48:19.831 --> 00:48:23.685
No child left behind.

632
00:48:23.768 --> 00:48:26.254
He'll know what that means.

633
00:48:26.337 --> 00:48:28.290
OK.

634
00:48:39.984 --> 00:48:40.902
Any luck?

635
00:48:40.985 --> 00:48:44.706
We're somewhere in this green bit.

636
00:48:44.789 --> 00:48:48.577
Well, people used to live here,
so we can't be that lost.

637
00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:54.616
They probably got lost too, and then
just gave up. We'll probably die here.

638
00:48:54.699 --> 00:48:55.917
Well, anything to shut you up.

639
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.788
I'll shut up if that
stupid bird shuts up.

640
00:48:59.871 --> 00:49:01.723
Shut up, stupid bird!

641
00:49:01.806 --> 00:49:03.391
Shh.

642
00:49:03.474 --> 00:49:05.460
Just watch.

643
00:49:05.543 --> 00:49:08.930
Huh. Never seen a dumb
bird like that before.

644
00:49:11.115 --> 00:49:13.849
Just watch.

645
00:49:17.355 --> 00:49:20.222
It's a huia.

646
00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.713
I reckon that bird was a huia.

647
00:49:24.796 --> 00:49:26.448
Supposed to be extinct.

648
00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:29.834
That's pretty rare.

649
00:49:29.917 --> 00:49:33.221
Mate,... I reckon there'd be a lot of people
interested in seeing something like that.

650
00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:37.058
And the people who discovered
them would be... pretty famous.

651
00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:39.861
Yeah, probably some money in it too.

652
00:49:39.944 --> 00:49:44.232
Mind you, need some
photos to prove it.

653
00:49:44.315 --> 00:49:47.202
We don't have a camera.

654
00:49:47.285 --> 00:49:49.271
When was the last time you washed?

655
00:49:49.354 --> 00:49:51.139
About a month ago.

656
00:49:51.222 --> 00:49:53.689
Well, that's not enough, eh?

657
00:50:11.409 --> 00:50:12.560
OK, mate. Let's go.

658
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:20.001
What have you got there mate?

659
00:50:20.084 --> 00:50:22.070
Huh? Oh books.

660
00:50:22.153 --> 00:50:25.807
Books? Bloody books.
Look for food and warm stuff.

661
00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:29.544
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keep your pants on.

662
00:50:33.297 --> 00:50:35.917
Jeez. That's a ranger.

663
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.385
Oh, he's dead.

664
00:50:40.471 --> 00:50:41.990
Oh Jeez.

665
00:50:42.073 --> 00:50:44.993
You all right, mate?
What's the matter?

666
00:50:45.076 --> 00:50:46.628
Ricky, we've got to do something.

667
00:50:46.711 --> 00:50:49.431
Are you going to manslaughter him?
Because I don't think I can watch.

668
00:50:49.514 --> 00:50:52.734
No, you idiot. I'm- We've
got to get him some help.

669
00:50:52.817 --> 00:50:55.670
There's a track down to a river; there's
some bush people that live down there.

670
00:50:55.753 --> 00:50:56.805
It's about a two-hour trek.

671
00:50:56.888 --> 00:50:59.507
We can make it before dark.

672
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:03.611
Well, someone has got to stay
behind and look after this bloke.

673
00:51:03.694 --> 00:51:07.781
Have fun.

674
00:51:07.864 --> 00:51:11.953
Now don't go wandering; just stick to the
tracks. If you get desperate,... eat your dog.

675
00:51:12.036 --> 00:51:14.555
What?

676
00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:17.158
You'll be right, mate.
Just bloody well come back, OK?

677
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:19.260
OK.

678
00:51:52.376 --> 00:51:54.896
What do you think you're
doing out here, freaky kid?

679
00:51:54.979 --> 00:51:57.648
There's a sick man
up at Carrington Hut.

680
00:51:57.731 --> 00:52:00.402
He can't walk, and he's having trouble
breathing. Can you radio in a chopper?

681
00:52:00.485 --> 00:52:02.771
OK. Sweet as.

682
00:52:02.854 --> 00:52:09.711
"Uh, yeah, we need a
helicopter up here ASAP. Over."

683
00:52:09.794 --> 00:52:12.280
Does it look like I carry a radio?

684
00:52:12.363 --> 00:52:13.230
What's wrong with him?

685
00:52:13.313 --> 00:52:14.182
I don't know.
He might be dying.

686
00:52:14.265 --> 00:52:20.803
Ew. Oh, OK. Come on,
we'll go call the cop.

687
00:52:21.205 --> 00:52:24.106
Get on, man.

688
00:52:43.628 --> 00:52:47.949
I've already told you, Bruce- up at Carrington
Hut. He's probably already dead by now.

689
00:52:48.032 --> 00:52:50.501
Do you want some ice cream?

690
00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:53.054
How should I know? Do your job,
fly up there and take a look.

691
00:52:53.137 --> 00:52:55.824
I already told you that,
but you're not listening.

692
00:52:55.907 --> 00:52:58.493
Oh, yes, I do. I can. Uh...

693
00:52:58.576 --> 00:53:00.795
You want a sausage?

694
00:53:00.878 --> 00:53:03.098
Yeah, yeah. Do that.
Yeah, I'll tell him. Laters.

695
00:53:03.181 --> 00:53:04.899
They're gonna head up there
first thing in the morning.

696
00:53:04.982 --> 00:53:08.636
Better go, then. Got to get there
before they do so I can warn Uncle...

697
00:53:08.719 --> 00:53:11.940
Relax, bro. I know who you are.
I've seen your picture in the paper.

698
00:53:12.023 --> 00:53:15.410
Except you're skinnier in real life.

699
00:53:15.493 --> 00:53:16.678
Where's your parents?

700
00:53:16.761 --> 00:53:18.847
Dead.

701
00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:22.917
Nah, jokes. My, um, dad, he's watching
the league with my uncle, and my mum,

702
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.786
she's working at the lodge.

703
00:53:24.869 --> 00:53:27.455
Do you want to smoke a joint?

704
00:53:27.538 --> 00:53:30.859
Nah, I'm just being a dick.
I don't smoke. I'm talking heaps eh?

705
00:53:30.942 --> 00:53:35.563
Yeah, people say I talk too much. You
don't talk much, eh? I can talk for ages.

706
00:53:35.646 --> 00:53:38.199
If you want me to talk for ages,
or if you don't me to talk,

707
00:53:38.282 --> 00:53:40.467
just tell me if you
don't want me to talk.

708
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.737
Like, this one time I was school,
and I was talking too much,

709
00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:44.005
and the teacher walks in-

710
00:53:48.192 --> 00:53:50.678
I'm not listening to her,
because she's my Auntie...

711
00:53:52.163 --> 00:53:59.988
# Only the crumbliest, flakiest
chocolate. Tastes like...

712
00:54:00.071 --> 00:54:00.788
But then I just kept talking-

713
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:08.329
Hey, bub. Far out those bloody
Warriors are useless! Koretux.

714
00:54:08.412 --> 00:54:10.431
That's my dad.

715
00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:13.468
They are killing me.

716
00:54:13.551 --> 00:54:16.271
Hey.

717
00:54:16.354 --> 00:54:18.506
You're him. You're you!
That's him!

718
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:23.044
Oh, Ricky Baker in my house.
You want, uh, anything?

719
00:54:23.127 --> 00:54:27.182
Sausage, bro? We've got heaps
of sausages, brother. Far...

720
00:54:27.265 --> 00:54:31.419
I hate to ask you this, Ricky,
but I'll kick myself if I don't.

721
00:54:31.502 --> 00:54:34.422
Um,...

722
00:54:34.505 --> 00:54:37.158
Can I have a selfie, please?

723
00:54:37.241 --> 00:54:40.861
Yeah? Yeah?

724
00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:44.566
Far! Oh my goodness. The boys
are gonna be buzzing on this one.

725
00:54:44.649 --> 00:54:46.568
Big smile. Big smile.

726
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:48.670
Sad face. Sad face.

727
00:54:50.688 --> 00:54:51.873
Just take a quick selfie of us.

728
00:54:51.956 --> 00:54:53.608
It's not a selfie if
I take it, you idiot.

729
00:54:53.691 --> 00:54:57.812
Oh, come on. Just pretend I'm
the head to his body. CLICK!

730
00:54:57.895 --> 00:55:01.082
I captured Ricky Baker!

731
00:55:01.165 --> 00:55:03.952
Yeah, you captured me too.
You captured me.

732
00:55:04.035 --> 00:55:06.788
Oh no!

733
00:55:06.871 --> 00:55:10.825
Yeah. Chur, my bro. Chur.
Thank you, my bro.

734
00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:13.962
Been awesome meeting you, Ricky.
Just keep doing what you're doing, man.

735
00:55:14.045 --> 00:55:17.865
Keep striving. Stay Maori, bro.
We need a couple more Maoris like you.

736
00:55:17.948 --> 00:55:18.700
Oh, shut up.

737
00:55:18.783 --> 00:55:19.968
No, you shut up, eh.

738
00:55:20.051 --> 00:55:24.105
Yeah, get out.

739
00:55:24.188 --> 00:55:28.243
I'm imparting my knowledge on the bro. You're
the man for me. You're a boy, but you're a man.

740
00:55:28.326 --> 00:55:33.896
Bro. I love you, Ricky.

741
00:55:41.372 --> 00:55:45.627
Why are you on the run?
Don't you want a normal life?

742
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:47.562
Don't know. Maybe.

743
00:55:47.645 --> 00:55:52.066
You fullas could come live here. They'll
never find you. Nobody ever comes in here.

744
00:55:52.149 --> 00:55:54.202
I have to ask Uncle first.

745
00:55:54.285 --> 00:55:56.638
They say he's dangerous.
You guys get along?

746
00:55:56.721 --> 00:55:59.674
Yeah, we're like best friends.
We get on so well.

747
00:55:59.757 --> 00:56:02.110
He's, like, one of the best
bushmans in the whole country.

748
00:56:02.193 --> 00:56:03.878
He, like, teached me
all of his skills,

749
00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:10.218
so now we're, like, equal best bushmen
in the country. Yeah, we're best friends.

750
00:56:10.301 --> 00:56:11.953
Oh, where's your mum and dad?

751
00:56:12.036 --> 00:56:18.459
Don't know who my dad was, and my
mum got rid of me when I was little.

752
00:56:18.542 --> 00:56:22.630
Oh, you know where she is?
You ever met her?

753
00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:27.416
You know anything about her?

754
00:56:34.191 --> 00:56:39.881
Oh, pretty. She must've had
you when she was a teenager.

755
00:56:39.964 --> 00:56:44.118
You ever try and find her?

756
00:56:44.201 --> 00:56:47.455
Oh, you don't have to.
She should find you.

757
00:56:47.538 --> 00:56:51.392
What do you reckon you'd say
to her if you ever met her?

758
00:56:51.475 --> 00:56:55.263
Don't know. Never
really think about it.

759
00:56:55.346 --> 00:56:58.399
You want to hear a song I wrote?

760
00:56:58.482 --> 00:57:02.217
OK. Here goes.
It's an original.

761
00:57:08.793 --> 00:57:11.713
# Turn your lights down low.

762
00:57:11.796 --> 00:57:15.216
OK, I lied. It's not an original.

763
00:57:15.299 --> 00:57:22.357
# And pull your window curtains.
# Your window curtains.

764
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:28.763
GIRL AND DAD SING # Oh, let
Jah moon come shining in.

765
00:57:28.846 --> 00:57:35.203
# Into our life again...

766
00:57:35.286 --> 00:57:45.346
# Saying, "Ooh, it's been
a long, long time..." #

767
00:57:50.401 --> 00:57:53.054
Morena, bro. Sausage?

768
00:57:53.137 --> 00:57:53.654
Oh no!

769
00:57:53.737 --> 00:57:54.789
Yeah bro, you slept in.

770
00:57:54.872 --> 00:57:56.557
Oh no!

771
00:58:07.518 --> 00:58:11.739
Man, we gotta work on your dismounts.

772
00:58:11.822 --> 00:58:13.441
You all good from here?

773
00:58:13.524 --> 00:58:15.410
Yeah.

774
00:58:15.493 --> 00:58:18.613
OK, Ricky bro, catch you up.

775
00:58:18.696 --> 00:58:22.049
Catch you up.

776
00:58:30.741 --> 00:58:32.193
Uncle!

777
00:58:32.276 --> 00:58:33.294
Tupac, come on!

778
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:41.502
Oh no!

779
00:58:41.585 --> 00:58:43.037
Ninjas!

780
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:47.041
Dire wolves!

781
00:58:47.124 --> 00:58:52.246
Child Welfare!

782
00:58:52.329 --> 00:58:59.687
Where did they go? Where did they go?!
I know you know something.

783
00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:01.638
He knows something.

784
00:59:01.721 --> 00:59:03.591
Paula, he's the ranger. He had
diabetes. They saved his life.

785
00:59:03.674 --> 00:59:04.459
Oh, spare me, Andy.

786
00:59:04.542 --> 00:59:05.960
This is Gavin, our tech guy.

787
00:59:06.043 --> 00:59:09.530
Gav, Paula Hall, Child Welfare
Services. No child left behind.

788
00:59:09.613 --> 00:59:11.732
So, talk to me, Gav.
What's the situation?

789
00:59:11.815 --> 00:59:15.603
Uh, well, the hut is empty so they
must've left before we got here.

790
00:59:15.686 --> 00:59:19.106
Ooh, you worked that
out on your own, Gav

791
00:59:19.189 --> 00:59:21.324
OK, what else?

792
00:59:21.407 --> 00:59:23.544
Well, uh, we've, ah, set up a rendezvous
spot here for the search party.

793
00:59:23.627 --> 00:59:26.514
And, uh, then we can
bring in, uh, Stingray.

794
00:59:26.597 --> 00:59:29.650
Stingray? Talk to me, talk to me.

795
00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:32.787
Oh, well, basically it's just a portable cell
phone tower that emits a false frequency.

796
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:37.058
So any cell phone in a 5 K radius will
latch on, thinking it's an ordinary network.

797
00:59:37.141 --> 00:59:41.062
Frickin' A, brother. That's some
"five eyes" shit right there.

798
00:59:41.145 --> 00:59:47.502
OK. Them clowns is
about to get Stingray-ed.

799
00:59:47.585 --> 00:59:51.806
Uncle, Uncle, Uncle.
Think, think, think, think.

800
00:59:51.889 --> 00:59:54.575
Oh! Tupac, find Zag.

801
00:59:56.226 --> 00:59:59.213
Oh, you're useless.
Oh! Think, Ricky, think.

802
00:59:59.296 --> 01:00:01.682
What would Uncle
do? What would Uncle do?

803
01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:06.220
Oh yes. Yes! Find water,
and then go to higher ground.

804
01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:08.923
And don't get naked.

805
01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:20.635
Ricky Baker and Hector Faulkner-

806
01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:25.172
two renegade outlaws on
the run for four months now,

807
01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:28.843
and fast becoming legends here in NZ.

808
01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:32.613
Faulkner and Baker's
popularity is on the rise

809
01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:37.351
after a valiant effort to save
a critically ill park ranger.

810
01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:42.890
The forces are circling against them,
and I am reminded of "First Blood".

811
01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:47.328
John Rambo, a man alone-
obviously they're two men alone-

812
01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:53.501
out there somewhere beyond the cutty
grass in this dense, thick bush.

813
01:00:53.584 --> 01:00:57.471
OK? Easy, efficient,
economic. All right, guys?

814
01:00:57.554 --> 01:00:59.273
Take us back a step.
What happened in...?

815
01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:02.710
Uh, I lost control and, uh,
I gave him the beating of his life.

816
01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:05.579
Yeah, you got him good.

817
01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:08.449
We're offering $10,000 to anyone
who can capture them, dead or alive.

818
01:01:08.532 --> 01:01:12.853
Oh,... alive.
They should be alive.

819
01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:23.811
They are fighting for freedom. And we believe
in freedom in NZ. It is a marvellous thing.

820
01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:29.737
Oi! Ricky! Freeze!

821
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:35.176
OK, OK. OK, Ricky. Stay there
we're coming over to you. Come on.

822
01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:38.846
It's too steep. It's too steep.
Ricky, you come across here.

823
01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:41.465
No.

824
01:01:41.548 --> 01:01:44.085
Just slide down the bank, cross this stream,
and then climb up to us. You're absolutely safe.

825
01:01:44.168 --> 01:01:47.154
All you have to do is grab some
branches or some roots. OK?

826
01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:48.405
No.

827
01:01:48.488 --> 01:01:49.657
Ricky. Come over here right now!

828
01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.592
I'm not going back.
I'm not going to juvie.

829
01:01:51.675 --> 01:01:57.398
You are playing with a bag of snakes,
boy. A big bag with a lot of holes in it.

830
01:01:57.481 --> 01:01:59.266
You've got the whole
country looking for you.

831
01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:01.484
I'll never stop running.

832
01:02:01.567 --> 01:02:03.704
Yeah, and I'll never stop chasing you.
I'm relentless. I'm like the Terminator.

833
01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:05.239
I'm more like Terminator than you.

834
01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.608
I said it first. You're
more like Sarah Connor.

835
01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:09.776
No, I'm not.

836
01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:11.946
Yes. And in the first movie too,
before she could do chin-ups.

837
01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:15.750
It doesn't have to be
this difficult, Ricky. Yeah?

838
01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:20.354
You're cold, you're damp...
and hungry.

839
01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:23.457
Look at that- scroggin.

840
01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.360
Got some nuts and dried fruit...

841
01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:29.664
Little pieces of chocolate.
Yum. Delicious.

842
01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:31.298
We could cut a deal; make a trade.

843
01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.834
What kind of deal?

844
01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.370
The old man.

845
01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:39.306
You say that he made you do it,
let him take the rap,

846
01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:42.043
and I'll make sure you
never go back to juvie.

847
01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:46.981
We'll find you a new
foster home; a new Bella.

848
01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:48.565
No deal.

849
01:02:48.648 --> 01:02:50.151
Oh, come on, Sarah Connor.
Don't be a fool.

850
01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:52.253
You don't trade family for anything.

851
01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:54.255
Well, you just keep running.

852
01:02:54.338 --> 01:02:57.591
He's here! He's here.
We got him!

853
01:02:57.674 --> 01:03:00.361
Go! Go! Go!

854
01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:30.725
OK. So you ate a sausage,
she sang a song, and you went to sleep.

855
01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:35.329
What? It was a relaxing song...
and a relaxing sausage.

856
01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.502
Do you think we've walked a thousand
miles yet? Like the wildebeest?

857
01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:44.855
Well, it feels like it, eh?

858
01:03:44.938 --> 01:03:48.209
Yeah. Always on the move,
always on the lookout for hunters,

859
01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:53.881
just like the wildebeest,
except humans.

860
01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:56.917
We're... Wilderpeople.

861
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.886
Yeah, that's us.

862
01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:02.857
OK then, Wilderboy, let's
find somewhere to eat, shall we?

863
01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:03.924
There they are!

864
01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:06.393
Freeze!

865
01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:10.097
Shit just got real. Again.

866
01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.232
Now, drop your weapons.

867
01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:12.366
We're not holding any weapons-

868
01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.449
Drop 'em!

869
01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:19.454
Go see what they got, Ricky.

870
01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:23.144
Baked beans,

871
01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:24.912
spaghetti,

872
01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:27.047
ba- baba- What?

873
01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:29.216
Oh, baba ganoush.

874
01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:30.117
What?

875
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.320
Baba ganoush.

876
01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:34.088
What?

877
01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:36.023
Binoculars,

878
01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:40.775
rope, gaffer tape.

879
01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:44.565
Get their guns, Ricky.

880
01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:48.269
Give me your guns.

881
01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:50.638
Take the bolts out.

882
01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:53.374
There's a reward for your capture.

883
01:04:53.457 --> 01:04:54.942
How much?

884
01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:56.243
10 grand.

885
01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:59.828
Tell us when it gets to 20.

886
01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:06.253
And when they ask who did this,
tell them it was the Wilderpeople.

887
01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:09.156
The What-er-people?

888
01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:12.293
The Wilderpeople.

889
01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:31.178
No, I can't go back there. It wasn't
my farm; you know that. It was Bella's.

890
01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:35.883
She ran the show. I could do stuff- me
and the dog- but she was the farmer.

891
01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:37.451
And the cook.

892
01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:39.687
Yeah, a bloody good cook too.

893
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:44.859
But you- you can't keep on the run forever.
You've got to go back to society, you know that.

894
01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:47.928
I'm a menace to society.

895
01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:50.998
Anyway, if I ever went back, I'd probably
end up driving a steamroller or something.

896
01:05:51.081 --> 01:05:53.200
That's what happens to gangsters.

897
01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:55.970
Well, there's nothing wrong with that,
but if you're better at something else,

898
01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:57.638
then you should probably
give that a go, shouldn't you?

899
01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:00.207
Yeah, but I'm better
at being a gangster.

900
01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.408
You're not a bloody gangster.

901
01:06:01.491 --> 01:06:03.710
How would you know?

902
01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:06.013
Because I've known real gangsters,
and they're a lot tougher than you are.

903
01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:08.215
Yeah, but were they skux, though?

904
01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.251
Skux? What the hell does that mean?

905
01:06:10.334 --> 01:06:13.087
You know,... skux.

906
01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:17.224
Yeah, but what does it mean?

907
01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:21.362
Everything. It's cool, spunky, brainy,
good-looking, you know, gangster.

908
01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:25.065
Oh, for God's sake.
You're not a bloody gangster!

909
01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:27.568
Oh, jeez.

910
01:06:29.052 --> 01:06:30.804
Zag!
Tupac!

911
01:06:30.887 --> 01:06:32.640
Get back, Zag! Get back!
Come back here, you-!

912
01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:35.175
Get in behind!
Get in behind, Zag!

913
01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:36.110
Zag!

914
01:06:41.298 --> 01:06:42.716
Zag!

915
01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:45.753
Get out of it, you mongrel!

916
01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:50.591
Shit.

917
01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.175
Uncle!

918
01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:04.879
What have you done?

919
01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:15.023
Oh jeez.

920
01:08:22.766 --> 01:08:24.718
Give us your gun, mate.
Hm?

921
01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:26.253
Go on, get out.
No, Uncle.

922
01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:27.954
Get out of- Uncle!

923
01:08:28.037 --> 01:08:29.656
Get out of here, Ricky.
Go on, get out.

924
01:08:29.739 --> 01:08:34.109
But can't we just-?
Go!

925
01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:00.254
What does that say?

926
01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:02.937
Zag.

927
01:09:03.306 --> 01:09:05.874
Good.

928
01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:29.776
So, she's been with us
the whole time, eh?

929
01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.145
Yeah.

930
01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:37.417
Well, pretty close
to the sky up here.

931
01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.435
Thanks for bringing her, mate.

932
01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:58.305
# When they poured across the border,
I was cautioned to surrender.

933
01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:02.809
# This I could not do.

934
01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:06.961
# I took my gun and vanished.

935
01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.757
# I have changed my name so often,

936
01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.626
# I've lost my wife and children.

937
01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:23.177
# But I've many friends.

938
01:11:24.247 --> 01:11:28.116
# And some of them are with me.

939
01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:35.309
# Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing.

940
01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:38.478
# Through the graves,
the wind is blowing.

941
01:11:38.561 --> 01:11:41.462
# Freedom soon will come.

942
01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:47.101
# Then we'll come from the shadows.

943
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:57.064
# Un vieil homme dans un grenier

944
01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:59.766
# pour la nuit nous a cachs.

945
01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:03.084
# Les Allemands l'ont pris.

946
01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:12.327
# Il est mort sans surprise.

947
01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:18.185
# Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing.

948
01:12:18.268 --> 01:12:21.088
# Through the graves,
the wind is blowing.

949
01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:26.026
# Freedom soon will come.

950
01:12:26.109 --> 01:12:30.445
# Then we'll come from the shadows. #

951
01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.846
I wonder how long they're
going to hunt us for.

952
01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:51.785
Oh, it's hard to say. Those idiots
are worse in the bush than you are.

953
01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.321
Useless. Couldn't find
a clown in a circus.

954
01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:55.656
Stop!
This is the police!

955
01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:57.691
Oh shit!

956
01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:30.324
What?

957
01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:45.119
I was trying to tell you it
was like The Lord of the Rings.

958
01:14:10.079 --> 01:14:13.033
What the...?

959
01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:15.702
Can you see that bush over there?

960
01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:18.419
Yeah.

961
01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:24.459
Is it a man or a bush?

962
01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:27.714
Bush!

963
01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.783
Man!

964
01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:33.634
Bushman!

965
01:14:35.738 --> 01:14:38.091
Ah!

966
01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:40.627
Hello. I was hoping
to run into you two.

967
01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:44.698
Well, if you're after the reward,
you can bugger off. We're dangerous.

968
01:14:44.781 --> 01:14:47.300
Yeah, we're dangerous.

969
01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:49.903
Yeah, no. I heard about that. Don't
worry. I'm not going to capture you.

970
01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.605
You guys heard of a- a local legend

971
01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:56.076
about a guy who lives out
here in the bush on this own?

972
01:14:56.159 --> 01:15:00.728
They call him Psycho Sam!

973
01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:03.350
No.

974
01:15:03.433 --> 01:15:06.319
No? Oh, OK.

975
01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:08.889
Well, my name is Sam, anyway.

976
01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:14.208
I'm a friend!
Come on.

977
01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:31.292
Bikkie?

978
01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:43.056
Why do you reckon
he calls himself Psycho Sam?

979
01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:47.761
Here you go. Put these on.
Stop the Government from tracking you.

980
01:15:47.844 --> 01:15:50.746
Never mind.

981
01:15:50.829 --> 01:15:53.733
That fulla you saved- he was a ranger.
Diabetic. You got a little support over that.

982
01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:56.436
But then you robbed those hunters,
so you're back in the negatives again.

983
01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:58.939
Well, that was... this fella.
He's the maniac.

984
01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:02.676
Well, they're still saying you're
dangerous. And a bit of a pervert.

985
01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:05.061
Goddammit.

986
01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:07.447
It's all right. You can stay here as long
as you like. I've been up here 15 years now.

987
01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:10.217
Got everything I need.
How long they been chasing ya?

988
01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.118
I don't know.
About five months now?

989
01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:14.120
Bastards. That's the
typical government.

990
01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:16.556
Always trying to step on the little
guy just for living his life.

991
01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:21.895
It never stops either. That's why I can't go
back. Not going to be part of the machine.

992
01:16:21.978 --> 01:16:23.063
Form fillers.

993
01:16:23.146 --> 01:16:25.999
Form fillers?

994
01:16:26.082 --> 01:16:28.045
That's how they get you.

995
01:16:28.128 --> 01:16:30.091
Anything you want to do in life,
you got to fill out a form.

996
01:16:30.174 --> 01:16:32.138
And they've got forms for everything.
You fill it out, it goes upstairs,

997
01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:33.673
and then they make you
fill out a new form,

998
01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.775
just to confirm it was you
that filled out the first form.

999
01:16:35.858 --> 01:16:37.477
And if ever you want to
stop filling out forms,

1000
01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.780
well, there's about five
different forms for that.

1001
01:16:40.863 --> 01:16:47.435
Don't even get me started on the
national rugby team. They're not human.

1002
01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:04.437
What you doing, mate?

1003
01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.672
Writing.

1004
01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:09.876
And what are you writing,
Mr Shakespeare?

1005
01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.878
Haiku.

1006
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:15.215
Well, go on, read it out.
I'll tell you if it's any good.

1007
01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.317
No, it's just a personal one.

1008
01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.986
Oh, come on. Don't be shy.

1009
01:17:20.069 --> 01:17:23.924
Mm, OK.

1010
01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:27.894
Trees, birds, rivers, sky.

1011
01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:30.564
Running with my Uncle Hec.

1012
01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:32.980
Living forever.

1013
01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:37.952
See? Told you it was dumb.

1014
01:17:39.522 --> 01:17:42.242
No, no.

1015
01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:44.811
It was just that

1016
01:17:44.894 --> 01:17:46.846
Well, that's the-

1017
01:17:46.929 --> 01:17:54.402
That's the first time I've...
heard my name in a poem. I liked it.

1018
01:17:56.139 --> 01:17:59.659
Gee, Bella would have loved
this adventure, wouldn't she?

1019
01:17:59.742 --> 01:18:04.164
Mm. Why couldn't you
guys have any kids?

1020
01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:06.766
Well, just couldn't.

1021
01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:10.637
Well, I couldn't.</font>

1022
01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:14.574
That's not very fair. Some
people can't even have babies.

1023
01:18:14.657 --> 01:18:20.080
And the ones who can-
they don't even want them.

1024
01:18:20.163 --> 01:18:21.982
Like my mum.

1025
01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:25.401
No, mate. She wanted you.

1026
01:18:25.484 --> 01:18:28.822
She was- she was probably just young. She
couldn't work out how to raise you, you know.

1027
01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:30.924
I bet she loved you, though.

1028
01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:32.025
Doubt it.

1029
01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:34.194
Well, you never know.

1030
01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:37.578
You're pretty likeable.

1031
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.873
Lights out, OK?

1032
01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:48.708
Goodnight, Sam.

1033
01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:53.179
Oh, I haven't got that fixed yet.

1034
01:18:53.262 --> 01:18:54.881
Goodnight, Uncle.

1035
01:18:54.964 --> 01:18:57.565
Goodnight, mate.

1036
01:19:32.769 --> 01:19:35.836
Uncle!

1037
01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:44.698
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle! Uncle! Uncle, we have to go!

1038
01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:47.500
Yeah. Even I can't stand
his cooking anymore.

1039
01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:49.202
We'll get out off first
thing in the morning, eh?

1040
01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:50.637
No! They're here.

1041
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:51.887
Who?

1042
01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:53.139
Government! Government!
Sorry, excuse me.

1043
01:19:53.222 --> 01:19:54.240
Did they see you?

1044
01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:55.875
No, but they're close!

1045
01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:57.110
OK. Get our stuff!

1046
01:19:57.193 --> 01:19:59.312
Hey! Hey, what happened to my phone?

1047
01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:01.681
I upgraded it for ya.
You're on four bars now.

1048
01:20:01.764 --> 01:20:03.817
You clown. What have you done?

1049
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.385
Come out and give over
the boy, Mr Faulkner.

1050
01:20:05.468 --> 01:20:07.187
Uncle! Uncle! They're close.

1051
01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:10.356
Sam, what's the fastest
way out of here?

1052
01:20:10.439 --> 01:20:11.540
Jet pack.

1053
01:20:11.623 --> 01:20:12.726
Do you actually have a jet pack?

1054
01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:13.893
No. What?

1055
01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:17.630
Wait! I've got an
underground bunker.

1056
01:20:17.713 --> 01:20:21.234
This tunnel leads directly
to an underground chamb-

1057
01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:22.902
I haven't dug it yet. Oh!

1058
01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:26.638
What have I been doing with my life?

1059
01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:30.376
That's it. We've run out of options.
Just pretend to be dead. I'll be here.

1060
01:20:30.459 --> 01:20:32.679
Come on, guys. It only
works if we all do it.

1061
01:20:32.762 --> 01:20:37.117
For Christ's sake, Sam, pull yourself
together. We need to get out of here right now.

1062
01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.120
What are we gonna do?

1063
01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:40.754
Crumpy!

1064
01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:41.488
What?

1065
01:20:41.571 --> 01:20:42.522
Crumpy will take you!

1066
01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:45.739
Who the hell is Crumpy?!

1067
01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:49.963
Crumpy!

1068
01:20:50.046 --> 01:20:51.498
Jesus, does she even go?

1069
01:20:51.581 --> 01:20:54.467
Crumpy. Unkillable.
Four-wheel drive.

1070
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:56.402
Both wheels go- go four-wheel-drive.

1071
01:20:56.485 --> 01:20:57.303
Ricky, where are ya?

1072
01:20:57.386 --> 01:20:58.972
Oh, where did I put the keys?

1073
01:20:59.055 --> 01:20:59.472
Ricky!

1074
01:21:01.224 --> 01:21:02.041
Unkillable!

1075
01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:02.675
Ricky...

1076
01:21:02.758 --> 01:21:03.909
Get in!

1077
01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:05.145
Ricky Baker, you are
not driving this ute.

1078
01:21:05.228 --> 01:21:07.995
Get in the car!

1079
01:21:08.331 --> 01:21:11.184
Oh shit.

1080
01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:13.953
Tupac!

1081
01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:17.190
OK. I'll hold up the government
and buy you some time.

1082
01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:18.858
Thanks, mate.
Don't do anything stupid.

1083
01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:22.476
Me?

1084
01:21:24.714 --> 01:21:26.099
How did you get this thing started?

1085
01:21:26.182 --> 01:21:27.534
The knack.

1086
01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:35.823
Crumpy!

1087
01:21:42.965 --> 01:21:45.518
Hey! Sorry, mate.
She's a bit bumpy around here.

1088
01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:49.989
Not too fast, Ricky. Slow down.

1089
01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:53.026
No! No!

1090
01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:55.161
Tree!

1091
01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.162
Get off!

1092
01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:59.647
Slow down!

1093
01:22:04.987 --> 01:22:05.538
That's my bike.

1094
01:22:05.621 --> 01:22:09.123
Shut up, they're mine.

1095
01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:20.369
Whoa.

1096
01:22:20.452 --> 01:22:21.921
SIRENS WAIL Uh-oh.

1097
01:22:22.004 --> 01:22:25.357
May as well play it to the end.
What do you reckon?

1098
01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.795
You mean have a shoot out, and then when we've
got no bullets, run out and say, "Freedom!"

1099
01:22:28.878 --> 01:22:30.964
And then die in a blaze of glory?

1100
01:22:31.047 --> 01:22:34.067
No. I actually meant
till we run out of petrol.

1101
01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:36.536
Oh. Well, I'm dying
in a blaze of glory.

1102
01:22:36.619 --> 01:22:40.254
ENGINE REVS No!

1103
01:22:44.994 --> 01:22:53.319
Oh.

1104
01:23:47.957 --> 01:23:49.442
Whoa.

1105
01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:55.048
Faulkner! This is the Police.
Stop the vehicle and hand over the boy.

1106
01:23:55.131 --> 01:23:59.185
You're pretty much
surrounded. No escape.

1107
01:23:59.268 --> 01:24:01.087
Come on mate.

1108
01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.655
Mr Faulkner... Mr Faulk-

1109
01:24:03.906 --> 01:24:06.492
Pull the bloody vehicle
over, Faulkner.

1110
01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:08.027
Ricky Baker!

1111
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:10.512
Hi, Paula!

1112
01:24:10.595 --> 01:24:12.999
You pull that ute over right now or you're
going to be in a whole lot of trouble, son!

1113
01:24:13.082 --> 01:24:16.970
You don't even have
your full licence!

1114
01:24:19.488 --> 01:24:21.955
Ricky!

1115
01:24:26.695 --> 01:24:29.881
Is that what I think it is?

1116
01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:33.152
Uncle Hec! Uncle Hec, that's the actual army.
This is like an actual war, like, for real!

1117
01:25:25.888 --> 01:25:28.141
Roger, Comms, we have visual.

1118
01:25:28.224 --> 01:25:33.193
Kilo, Foxtrot. We've
lost them in the bush.

1119
01:25:36.599 --> 01:25:41.054
OK. Stop the truck, Ricky. I just-
stop the truck. I want to get out now.

1120
01:25:41.137 --> 01:25:45.024
I didn't choose the skux life;
the skux life chose me.

1121
01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:46.191
Ricky, stop.

1122
01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:47.360
ENGINE REVS Stop!

1123
01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:51.197
Freedom!</font>

1124
01:26:23.946 --> 01:26:25.631
How many bullets do we have?

1125
01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:27.366
Ricky, we've got to stop.

1126
01:26:27.449 --> 01:26:31.019
Never! Come on!

1127
01:26:31.102 --> 01:26:34.674
Mate, this is it for me. Look, I can't go on
anymore. My leg is buggered. I can hardly see.

1128
01:26:34.757 --> 01:26:35.508
This is the end.

1129
01:26:49.071 --> 01:26:51.557
Ricky Baker, you get out
here this instant, son.

1130
01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.227
You've caused a lot of damage
to private property today.

1131
01:26:54.310 --> 01:27:02.201
You've taken out this corrugated
iron fence. Not cool, not cheap.

1132
01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:05.471
Ricky, this isn't a game.
That's real over there.

1133
01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:08.774
They're never gonna stop
chasing, ever. We're done.

1134
01:27:08.857 --> 01:27:11.277
I'm not going back!

1135
01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.713
Listen, it's over.

1136
01:27:13.796 --> 01:27:14.680
Traitor!

1137
01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:19.485
Give me your gun! Give me it!
Oi, you! Give me your gun.

1138
01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:20.402
Where's your taser?

1139
01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:21.320
It's been booked.
It's in Wellington.

1140
01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:23.556
Oh for God's sake!

1141
01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:25.091
It wasn't me!

1142
01:27:25.174 --> 01:27:29.629
You idiot, what did I tell
you about gun responsibility?

1143
01:27:29.712 --> 01:27:31.330
That's it. I'm giving you up.

1144
01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.766
We give up!

1145
01:27:33.849 --> 01:27:36.302
We give up!

1146
01:27:36.385 --> 01:27:38.404
He's molestering me!

1147
01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:40.907
I knew it.

1148
01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:42.842
You little bastard!

1149
01:27:42.925 --> 01:27:44.744
He's a molesterer!

1150
01:27:44.827 --> 01:27:49.949
I'm not! He's lying!
I'm not a molesterer!

1151
01:27:50.032 --> 01:27:51.551
I bloody hate you.

1152
01:27:51.634 --> 01:27:53.519
I hate you too, traitor!

1153
01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:58.591
That's it. You're on your own.

1154
01:27:58.674 --> 01:28:01.141
Don't shoot!

1155
01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:16.509
Don't you take another step.

1156
01:28:16.592 --> 01:28:18.927
What do you think you're doing?

1157
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:21.347
What do you think he's doing, Andy?

1158
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:23.198
Andy?

1159
01:28:23.281 --> 01:28:25.051
You're not going anywhere.
We stick together!

1160
01:28:25.134 --> 01:28:27.787
What, are you gonna shoot me?

1161
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:29.956
Do it.

1162
01:28:30.039 --> 01:28:31.924
We're family!

1163
01:28:32.007 --> 01:28:33.893
Like hell.

1164
01:28:33.976 --> 01:28:35.494
Go ahead. Shoot me.

1165
01:28:35.577 --> 01:28:38.497
Got you now, perv.

1166
01:28:40.115 --> 01:28:42.317
Oh!

1167
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.604
You shot me! I'm- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
It was an accident!

1168
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:51.310
I've got him! I've got the package!

1169
01:28:51.393 --> 01:28:55.348
Well done, everybody! Now let's get
this precious child out of here!

1170
01:28:55.431 --> 01:28:58.951
I'm sorry, Uncle. No! I'm not your
bloody uncle. I didn't mean to!

1171
01:28:59.034 --> 01:29:01.754
Hector Faulkner,
you are under arrest.

1172
01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:07.326
Whatever you do or say will be
used against you in a court of law!

1173
01:29:07.409 --> 01:29:11.296
Paula!

1174
01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:15.268
Police in NZ don't really say that. That's
like an American thing. And you're not a cop.

1175
01:29:15.351 --> 01:29:18.352
It's over.

1176
01:29:32.668 --> 01:29:34.654
Get in.

1177
01:29:34.737 --> 01:29:37.957
Oh!

1178
01:30:17.346 --> 01:30:21.967
Yeah, I found him on my horse,
and we had some sausages...

1179
01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:24.970
Uh, I'm a big fan and, uh,
managed to scab me a selfie.

1180
01:30:25.053 --> 01:30:28.374
I said that I was the Terminator
and he was in fact Sarah Connor.

1181
01:30:28.457 --> 01:30:32.144
I said, "I didn't choose the skux life,
uh, the skux life chose me."

1182
01:30:32.227 --> 01:30:34.814
Who is going to give him that
upbringing? Is it perhaps...?

1183
01:30:34.897 --> 01:30:43.823
We just want what's best
for the child, Your Honour.

1184

01:32:23.839 --> 01:32:26.640
Ca-caw, Hec!

1191
01:32:32.014 --> 01:32:34.848
Hi.

1192
01:32:38.353 --> 01:32:42.556
How was jail?
Did you shank anyone?

1193
01:32:45.961 --> 01:32:48.180
I'm sorry.

1194
01:32:48.263 --> 01:32:51.150
I'm sorry that I shot you,...

1195
01:32:51.233 --> 01:32:52.985
and I'm sorry that
I burnt down your shed.

1196
01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:54.753
That's enough.

1197
01:32:54.836 --> 01:32:56.522
And I'm sorry for what I said that day,
about you being a molesterer.

1198
01:32:56.605 --> 01:32:58.858
That really is enough;
I'm getting uncomfortable.

1199
01:32:58.941 --> 01:33:04.544
I just got carried away being
an outlaw; had too much fun.

1200
01:33:11.119 --> 01:33:15.690
Been doing all right?

1201
01:33:15.773 --> 01:33:20.346
Yeah, I just had to stick it out in a new
family for a year. I did. You'll like them.

1202
01:33:20.429 --> 01:33:25.184
Man, you'd love it there. There's heaps
of room, they need some help on the farm,

1203
01:33:25.267 --> 01:33:27.286
it's right next to the bush...

1204
01:33:27.369 --> 01:33:31.190
Oh, and I also saved up and got this.

1205
01:33:31.273 --> 01:33:32.825
You want to find that bird?

1206
01:33:32.908 --> 01:33:34.693
Yeah. We'll be famous.

1207
01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:37.830
Nah, you're
better off without me, mate.

1208
01:33:37.913 --> 01:33:39.632
Yeah. But I...

1209
01:33:39.715 --> 01:33:43.416
I just thought that...

1210
01:33:46.655 --> 01:33:48.908
OK.

1211
01:33:48.991 --> 01:33:52.192
Sorry.

1212
01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:01.868
Hey. Wait on.

1213
01:34:03.305 --> 01:34:07.359
I've got something to say.</font>

1214
01:34:07.442 --> 01:34:11.830
Me and this fat kid-

1215
01:34:11.913 --> 01:34:18.003
We ran, we ate, and read books.

1216
01:34:18.086 --> 01:34:21.988
And it was the best.

1217
01:34:28.230 --> 01:34:30.830
It was the best.

1218
01:34:32.801 --> 01:34:34.920
Yeah.

1219
01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:39.358
Look, to tell you the truth,

1220
01:34:39.441 --> 01:34:43.862
I can't stand it here.
It's full of old people.

1221
01:34:43.945 --> 01:34:48.467
So... you're coming?

1222
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:52.638
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming. Wouldn't
want a little twerp like you

1223
01:34:52.721 --> 01:34:56.508
to get all the credit
for finding a bird.

1224
01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:58.444
Yeah, but I've got one rule-

1225
01:34:58.527 --> 01:35:02.648
you got to let me call you "Uncle".

1226
01:35:02.731 --> 01:35:06.218
Uncle?

1227
01:35:06.301 --> 01:35:08.253
Yeah, I can stand that.

1228
01:35:08.336 --> 01:35:11.390
I've got one rule too.

1229
01:35:11.473 --> 01:35:14.040
Not allowed to shoot me.

1230
01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:30.056
OK, I'll... I'll go
and get my toothbrush.

1231
01:35:47.609 --> 01:35:50.062
Here we go. Reckon you can handle it?

1232
01:35:50.145 --> 01:35:53.132
What do you think?

1233
01:35:53.215 --> 01:35:55.467
Reckon you can find that bird?

1234
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:58.170
Yeah. I think I know where it is.

1235
01:35:58.253 --> 01:36:02.808
Seem to remember it was a
pretty beautiful place, was it?

1236
01:36:02.891 --> 01:36:06.426
Yeah. Majestical.

1237
01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:10.282
Come on. Let's go.

1238
01:36:10.365 --> 01:36:12.918
Don't slow me down, old fulla.

1239
01:36:13.001 --> 01:36:17.856
Keep up yourself, young player. Get in
my way, I'll have your guts for garters.

1240
01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:21.326
Well, I honestly don't know what
"guts for garters" is, so...

1241
01:36:21.409 --> 01:36:22.795
Well, it's gangster talk.

1242
01:36:22.878 --> 01:36:25.397
Yeah. We didn't chose
the skux life...

1243
01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:27.466
... the skux life chose us.

1244
01:36:27.549 --> 01:36:30.936
Yeah.</font>
