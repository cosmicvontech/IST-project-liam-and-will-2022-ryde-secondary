00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.020
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

2
00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:05.231
Ooh, black and yellow!
Yeah, let's shake it up a little.

3
00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.953
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

4
00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.371
Coming!

5
00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:23.701
Hang on a second.

6
00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:25.283
Hello?

7
00:01:25.326 --> 00:01:26.411
- Barry?
- Adam?

8
00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:30.081
- Can you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

9
00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:34.419
Looking sharp.

10
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.175
Barry, why don't you use the stairs.
Your father paid good money for those.

11
00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.677
Sorry. I'm excited.

12
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.680
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

13
00:01:45.763 --> 00:01:48.182
And a perfect report card, all B's.

14
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.517
Very proud.

15
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.686
Ma! I got a thing going here.

16
00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:54.272
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

17
00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:58.026
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

18
00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.486
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

19
00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:24.135
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

20
00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:27.597
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. It's a special day, finally graduating.

21
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.926
Never thought I'd make it.

22
00:02:28.973 --> 00:02:31.726
Yeah, three days of grade school,
three days of high school.

23
00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:32.894
Those were awkward.

24
00:02:32.977 --> 00:02:37.148
Three days of college. I'm glad I took off one day
in the middle and just hitch-hiked around the hive.

25
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:38.983
You did come back different.

26
00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:40.568
- Hi, Barry.
- Hey Artie.

27
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:42.820
Artie, growing a moustache? Looks good.

28
00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:45.573
- Hey, did you hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:48.368
- You going to his funeral?
- No, I'm not going to his funeral.

30
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:50.313
Everybody knows,
you sting someone, you die.

31
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.122
You don't waste it on a squirrel.
He's such a hothead.

32
00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:55.750
Yeah, I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

33
00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:07.053
I love this incorporating an amusement
park right into our regular day.

34
00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:09.514
I guess that's why they say
we don't need vacations.

35
00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.023
Boy, quite a bit of pomp,
under the circumstances.

36
00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:25.488
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

37
00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:26.864
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

38
00:03:26.948 --> 00:03:28.282
Hallelujah!

39
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.370
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

40
00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:34.972
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

41
00:03:35.998 --> 00:03:40.545
Welcome, New Hive City
graduating class of

42
00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:42.713
9:15.

43
00:03:43.701 --> 00:03:45.828
And that concludes our
graduation ceremonies.

44
00:03:47.635 --> 00:03:51.764
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

45
00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:53.391
Are we gonna pick our job today?

46
00:03:53.474 --> 00:03:55.309
I heard it's just orientation.

47
00:03:55.393 --> 00:03:57.395
Heads up! Here we go.

48
00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:02.525
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

49
00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.412
- Wonder what it's gonna be like?
- A little scary.

50
00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:18.722
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

51
00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:21.502
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

52
00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:23.004
This is it!

53
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:26.799
Wow.

54
00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:33.014
Wow.

55
00:04:33.097 --> 00:04:36.184
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

56
00:04:36.267 --> 00:04:40.354
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

57
00:04:40.438 --> 00:04:44.734
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

58
00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.792
Our top-secret formula

59
00:04:46.812 --> 00:04:51.199
is automatically colour-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

60
00:04:51.282 --> 00:04:53.550
into this soothing sweet syrup

61
00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:57.764
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

62
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:59.990
Honey!

63
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.732
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

64
00:05:04.862 --> 00:05:06.948
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

65
00:05:07.031 --> 00:05:10.827
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we also constantly strive

66
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.038
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

67
00:05:14.122 --> 00:05:17.708
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

68
00:05:33.808 --> 00:05:36.144
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

69
00:05:36.227 --> 00:05:39.897
And here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

70
00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:42.984
- What does that do?
- Catches that little strand of honey

71
00:05:43.067 --> 00:05:46.237
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

72
00:05:49.073 --> 00:05:51.033
Can anyone work on the Krelman?

73
00:05:51.117 --> 00:05:54.765
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

74
00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:58.833
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

75
00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:00.334
But choose carefully

76
00:06:00.418 --> 00:06:05.423
because you'll stay in the job you pick
for the rest of your life.

77
00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:10.011
The same job for the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

78
00:06:10.094 --> 00:06:11.804
What's the difference?

79
00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:16.726
And you'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

80
00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:19.312
in 27 million years.

81
00:06:20.472 --> 00:06:22.398
So you'll just work us to death?

82
00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:23.900
We'll sure try.

83
00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:44.712
Wow! That blew my mind!

84
00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:48.549
"What's the difference?"
Adam, how could you say that?

85
00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:50.134
One job forever?

86
00:06:50.218 --> 00:06:51.928
That's an insane choice
to have to make.

87
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.348
Well, I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

88
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:58.392
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

89
00:06:58.476 --> 00:07:01.020
Barry, why would you question anything?
We're bees.

90
00:07:01.103 --> 00:07:03.773
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

91
00:07:06.128 --> 00:07:09.715
Yeah, but Adam, did you ever think that maybe
things work a little too well around here?

92
00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:11.656
Like what? Give me one example.

93
00:07:15.326 --> 00:07:17.995
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

94
00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:24.460
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

95
00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:26.420
Wait a second. Check it out.

96
00:07:26.504 --> 00:07:28.798
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

97
00:07:40.601 --> 00:07:42.478
I've never seen them this close.

98
00:07:42.562 --> 00:07:44.522
They know what it's like
to go outside the hive.

99
00:07:44.605 --> 00:07:46.732
Yeah, but some don't come back.

100
00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:48.401
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

101
00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:13.509
You guys did great!

102
00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:18.347
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

103
00:08:18.431 --> 00:08:20.551
- I wonder where those guys just went.
- I don't know.

104
00:08:20.578 --> 00:08:22.018
Their day's not planned.

105
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.646
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

106
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.316
You can't just decide one day
to be a Pollen Jock.

107
00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:30.026
You have to be bred for that.

108
00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:31.444
Right.

109
00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:36.187
Look at that. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

110
00:08:36.233 --> 00:08:39.486
It's just a status symbol. I think
bees make too big a deal of it.

111
00:08:39.577 --> 00:08:45.291
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

112
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.377
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins, too?

113
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.129
Distant. Distant.

114
00:08:51.213 --> 00:08:52.381
Look at these two.

115
00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:55.343
- Couple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have some fun with them.

116
00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:57.970
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

117
00:08:58.054 --> 00:09:00.640
Yeah. One time a bear had me pinned up
against a mushroom!

118
00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:04.769
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he
was slapping me back and forth across the face!

119
00:09:04.852 --> 00:09:07.229
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

120
00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:09.190
What were you doing during all of this?

121
00:09:09.273 --> 00:09:11.150
Trying to alert the authorities.

122
00:09:11.233 --> 00:09:12.777
I can autograph that.

123
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.571
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

124
00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:17.031
Yeah. Gusty.

125
00:09:17.114 --> 00:09:20.534
We're gonna hit a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

126
00:09:20.618 --> 00:09:22.199
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

127
00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:25.873
It's a puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

128
00:09:25.956 --> 00:09:27.833
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

129
00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:30.503
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

130
00:09:31.962 --> 00:09:35.299
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

131
00:09:35.424 --> 00:09:39.595
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

132
00:09:48.864 --> 00:09:52.316
- Hey, Honex!
- Dad, you surprised me.

133
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.027
Have you decided what
you're interested in, son?

134
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:58.572
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

135
00:09:58.909 --> 00:10:01.826
Dad, do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

136
00:10:01.909 --> 00:10:03.911
Son, let me tell you
something about stirring.

137
00:10:03.994 --> 00:10:07.701
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

138
00:10:07.721 --> 00:10:11.127
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

139
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.671
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

140
00:10:13.754 --> 00:10:17.091
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

141
00:10:17.174 --> 00:10:19.802
And you were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

142
00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:22.430
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

143
00:10:22.513 --> 00:10:25.725
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

144
00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:29.603
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

145
00:10:29.687 --> 00:10:33.441
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

146
00:10:33.524 --> 00:10:36.318
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

147
00:10:36.402 --> 00:10:38.028
Wait till you see the
sticks I have for you.

148
00:10:38.112 --> 00:10:41.073
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

149
00:10:41.157 --> 00:10:43.409
Let's open some fresh honey and celebrate!

150
00:10:43.492 --> 00:10:46.871
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

151
00:10:46.954 --> 00:10:48.247
Shack up with a grasshopper.

152
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.000
Get a gold tooth
and start calling everybody "dawg"!

153
00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:52.501
I'm so proud.

154
00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:02.261
- I can't believe we're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

155
00:11:02.344 --> 00:11:04.346
Come on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

156
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.931
Yeah, right.

157
00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:10.936
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

158
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.564
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

159
00:11:13.647 --> 00:11:14.982
One of them's yours!

160
00:11:15.065 --> 00:11:16.905
Congratulations, son!
Step to the side, please.

161
00:11:17.568 --> 00:11:20.196
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. That is stellar!

162
00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:21.322
Wow!

163
00:11:21.405 --> 00:11:22.573
Couple of newbies?

164
00:11:22.656 --> 00:11:24.867
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

165
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.494
Well, step up and make your choice.

166
00:11:28.704 --> 00:11:30.956
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

167
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.000
Oh, my. What's available?

168
00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:35.836
Restroom attendant's always open,
and not for the reason you think.

169
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.632
- Any chance of getting onto the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

170
00:11:41.217 --> 00:11:43.636
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

171
00:11:43.719 --> 00:11:45.137
Wax monkey's always open.

172
00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:47.807
The Krelman opened up again.

173
00:11:47.932 --> 00:11:48.647
What happened?

174
00:11:48.694 --> 00:11:52.770
Whenever a bee dies, that's an opening.
See that? He's dead. Dead. Another dead one.

175
00:11:52.895 --> 00:11:54.688
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

176
00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:58.150
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. But that's life!

177
00:11:58.234 --> 00:12:00.402
Oh, this is so hard!

178
00:12:01.278 --> 00:12:03.540
Heating, cooling, stunt bee,
pourer, stirrer,

179
00:12:03.587 --> 00:12:08.035
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

180
00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:11.497
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

181
00:12:11.914 --> 00:12:13.249
Barry!

182
00:12:14.124 --> 00:12:18.087
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

183
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.755
What happened to you? Where are you?

184
00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.132
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

185
00:12:22.216 --> 00:12:23.717
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

186
00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:26.428
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

187
00:12:26.512 --> 00:12:29.223
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

188
00:12:29.306 --> 00:12:30.975
Another call coming in.

189
00:12:31.642 --> 00:12:35.584
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

190
00:12:35.638 --> 00:12:38.274
that gets their roses today.

191
00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:39.567
Hey, guys.

192
00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.778
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

193
00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:45.072
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

194
00:12:45.155 --> 00:12:47.241
It's okay, Lou.
We're gonna take him up.

195
00:12:47.324 --> 00:12:49.201
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

196
00:12:49.952 --> 00:12:52.746
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

197
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.331
- Thank you.
- Okay.

198
00:12:54.415 --> 00:12:56.039
You got a rain advisory today,

199
00:12:56.099 --> 00:13:00.379
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

200
00:13:00.462 --> 00:13:03.257
So be careful.
As always, watch your brooms,

201
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.802
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

202
00:13:06.832 --> 00:13:10.764
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

203
00:13:10.848 --> 00:13:15.519
Murphy's in a home because of it,
just babbling like a cicada!

204
00:13:15.686 --> 00:13:18.439
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

205
00:13:18.522 --> 00:13:22.610
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

206
00:13:22.633 --> 00:13:24.862
All right, launch positions!

207
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:30.868
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz!

208
00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:33.621
Black and yellow!

209
00:13:33.704 --> 00:13:34.872
Hello!

210
00:13:36.415 --> 00:13:38.208
You ready for this, hot shot?

211
00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:40.210
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

212
00:13:40.294 --> 00:13:41.629
Wind, check.

213
00:13:41.712 --> 00:13:43.714
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

214
00:13:43.797 --> 00:13:46.300
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

215
00:13:46.383 --> 00:13:48.385
Scared out of my shorts, check.

216
00:13:48.469 --> 00:13:51.972
Okay, ladies, let's move it out!

217
00:14:01.398 --> 00:14:05.736
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

218
00:14:06.153 --> 00:14:10.407
All of you, drain those flowers!

219
00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:28.759
Wow! I'm out!

220
00:14:29.593 --> 00:14:31.512
I can't believe I'm out!

221
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.099
So blue.

222
00:14:42.272 --> 00:14:44.608
I feel so fast and free!

223
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.444
Box kite!

224
00:14:49.029 --> 00:14:50.114
Wow!

225
00:15:05.462 --> 00:15:07.548
Flowers!

226
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.888
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

227
00:15:14.972 --> 00:15:17.057
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

228
00:15:17.141 --> 00:15:18.183
Roses!

229
00:15:18.267 --> 00:15:20.894
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

230
00:15:32.489 --> 00:15:34.992
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

231
00:15:42.416 --> 00:15:44.126
That is one nectar collector!

232
00:15:45.294 --> 00:15:47.671
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

233
00:15:47.755 --> 00:15:50.758
I pick up some pollen over here,
sprinkle it over here.

234
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:53.594
Maybe a dash over there,
a pinch on that one.

235
00:15:53.677 --> 00:15:55.888
See that? It's a little bit of magic, ain't it?

236
00:15:55.971 --> 00:15:58.265
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

237
00:15:58.348 --> 00:15:59.850
That's pollen power, kid.

238
00:15:59.933 --> 00:16:03.645
More pollen, more flowers, more nectar,
more honey for us.

239
00:16:03.729 --> 00:16:04.855
Cool.

240
00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:30.339
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Could be daisies. Don't we need those?

241
00:16:31.173 --> 00:16:32.466
Copy that visual.

242
00:16:32.549 --> 00:16:35.135
Hold up. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

243
00:16:35.219 --> 00:16:37.721
Say again?
Are you reporting a moving flower?

244
00:16:37.846 --> 00:16:39.181
Affirmative.

245
00:16:49.399 --> 00:16:51.276
That was on the line!

246
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.946
This is the coolest. What is it?

247
00:16:54.029 --> 00:16:56.615
I don't know, but I'm loving this colour.

248
00:16:56.698 --> 00:17:00.786
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

249
00:17:00.869 --> 00:17:02.454
Yeah, fuzzy.

250
00:17:02.538 --> 00:17:04.373
Chemical-y.

251
00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:06.625
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.

252
00:17:07.543 --> 00:17:09.837
My sweet lord of bees!

253
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.922
Candy-brain, get off there!

254
00:17:12.214 --> 00:17:13.715
Problem!

255
00:17:16.426 --> 00:17:18.554
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

256
00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:19.847
Affirmative.

257
00:17:20.222 --> 00:17:21.557
Very close.

258
00:17:22.724 --> 00:17:24.059
Gonna hurt.

259
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.228
Mama's little boy.

260
00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:28.230
You are way out of position, rookie!

261
00:17:31.233 --> 00:17:33.569
Coming in at you like a missile!

262
00:17:36.905 --> 00:17:39.116
Help me!

263
00:17:40.784 --> 00:17:42.536
You know, I don't think these are flowers.

264
00:17:42.619 --> 00:17:44.997
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

265
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.415
What is this?

266
00:17:51.128 --> 00:17:52.504
Match point!

267
00:17:52.588 --> 00:17:57.593
You can just start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

268
00:18:06.268 --> 00:18:08.061
Yowser!

269
00:18:36.506 --> 00:18:37.966
Gross.

270
00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:44.681
There's a bee in the car!

271
00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:48.685
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

272
00:18:48.769 --> 00:18:50.604
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

273
00:18:50.687 --> 00:18:52.397
He's going to sting me!

274
00:19:00.447 --> 00:19:04.576
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

275
00:19:05.994 --> 00:19:07.287
He blinked!

276
00:19:07.371 --> 00:19:08.497
Spray him, Granny!

277
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.082
What are you doing?

278
00:19:18.173 --> 00:19:21.510
Wow, the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

279
00:19:22.678 --> 00:19:24.179
I gotta get home.

280
00:19:34.064 --> 00:19:36.858
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.

281
00:19:37.234 --> 00:19:38.610
Can't fly in rain.

282
00:19:47.744 --> 00:19:50.580
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

283
00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:56.295
Ken, could you close
the window please?

284
00:19:56.378 --> 00:20:00.007
Check out my new résumé.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

285
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.883
You see? Folds out.

286
00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:04.386
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

287
00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:08.890
What was that?

288
00:20:08.974 --> 00:20:12.602
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

289
00:20:13.103 --> 00:20:14.938
Drapes!

290
00:20:15.022 --> 00:20:16.815
That is diabolical.

291
00:20:16.898 --> 00:20:20.068
It's fantastic.
It's got all of my special skills,

292
00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:21.820
even my top-ten favourite movies.

293
00:20:21.903 --> 00:20:23.739
What's your number one? Star Wars?

294
00:20:23.822 --> 00:20:25.282
Nah, I don't go for that

295
00:20:27.242 --> 00:20:28.535
kind of stuff.

296
00:20:28.618 --> 00:20:31.498
No wonder we're not supposed to talk
to them. They're out of their minds.

297
00:20:31.538 --> 00:20:33.678
When I walk out of a job interview,
they're flabbergasted,

298
00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:35.876
can't believe the things I say.

299
00:20:35.959 --> 00:20:38.920
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

300
00:20:39.588 --> 00:20:42.632
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

301
00:20:48.638 --> 00:20:51.350
I gotta tell ya, I
predicted global warming.

302
00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:55.145
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

303
00:20:55.812 --> 00:20:57.981
Wait! Stop! Bee!

304
00:21:00.108 --> 00:21:02.986
Stand back. These are winter boots.

305
00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:06.865
Wait!

306
00:21:07.282 --> 00:21:08.450
Don't kill him!

307
00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:11.661
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

308
00:21:11.745 --> 00:21:14.498
Why does his life have
any less value than yours?

309
00:21:14.956 --> 00:21:20.045
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

310
00:21:20.128 --> 00:21:22.506
I'm just saying all life has value.

311
00:21:22.589 --> 00:21:25.133
You don't know
what he's capable of feeling.

312
00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:28.637
My brochure!

313
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:45.070
There you go, little guy.

314
00:21:48.907 --> 00:21:51.701
I'm not scared of him but, you know.
It's an allergic thing.

315
00:21:51.785 --> 00:21:54.246
Put that on your résumé brochure.

316
00:21:54.329 --> 00:21:56.248
It's not funny. My whole face could puff up.

317
00:21:56.331 --> 00:21:58.291
Make it one of your special skills.

318
00:21:58.375 --> 00:22:01.336
You know, knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

319
00:22:04.673 --> 00:22:06.425
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

320
00:22:06.508 --> 00:22:10.095
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

321
00:22:10.178 --> 00:22:12.305
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

322
00:22:12.389 --> 00:22:14.683
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

323
00:22:21.314 --> 00:22:23.150
I gotta say something.

324
00:22:23.233 --> 00:22:26.403
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

325
00:22:27.904 --> 00:22:29.489
All right, here it goes.

326
00:22:41.376 --> 00:22:42.544
Nah.

327
00:22:49.426 --> 00:22:51.261
What would I say?

328
00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:55.724
I could really get in trouble.

329
00:22:57.642 --> 00:23:01.146
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

330
00:23:01.229 --> 00:23:03.064
I can't believe I'm doing this.

331
00:23:03.565 --> 00:23:05.025
I've got to.

332
00:23:05.108 --> 00:23:07.402
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

333
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.363
No. Yes. No.

334
00:23:10.447 --> 00:23:12.449
Do it. I can't.

335
00:23:12.908 --> 00:23:17.245
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

336
00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:19.831
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

337
00:23:20.665 --> 00:23:22.000
Hi!

338
00:23:22.083 --> 00:23:23.752
I'm sorry.

339
00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:25.921
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know. I know.

340
00:23:26.004 --> 00:23:27.506
You're talking!

341
00:23:27.589 --> 00:23:28.882
I'm so sorry.

342
00:23:28.965 --> 00:23:32.219
No, it's okay. It's fine. It's just...
I know I'm dreaming.

343
00:23:32.302 --> 00:23:34.111
But I don't recall going to bed.

344
00:23:34.177 --> 00:23:37.174
Well, You know, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

345
00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:41.801
Yeah, I mean this is a bit of a
surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!

346
00:23:41.827 --> 00:23:45.732
Yeah, I am a bee. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

347
00:23:45.815 --> 00:23:48.193
but they were all trying to kill me.

348
00:23:48.276 --> 00:23:50.570
And if it wasn't for you...

349
00:23:50.654 --> 00:23:53.156
I had to thank you.
It's just the way I was raised.

350
00:23:55.825 --> 00:23:57.327
That was a little weird.

351
00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.454
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

352
00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:03.250
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

353
00:24:03.333 --> 00:24:06.127
I just want you to know that I'm grateful.
And I'm gonna leave now.

354
00:24:06.211 --> 00:24:09.631
- Wait, wait, wait, wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

355
00:24:09.714 --> 00:24:12.050
The, the... The talking thing.

356
00:24:12.133 --> 00:24:16.137
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

357
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:17.889
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

358
00:24:17.973 --> 00:24:22.269
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

359
00:24:22.352 --> 00:24:23.395
Anyway...

360
00:24:23.478 --> 00:24:27.274
- Can I get you something?
- Like what?

361
00:24:27.357 --> 00:24:31.486
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Coffee?

362
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:33.863
Well, I don't want to put you out.

363
00:24:33.947 --> 00:24:36.449
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

364
00:24:36.533 --> 00:24:38.618
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

365
00:24:38.702 --> 00:24:41.496
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

366
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.123
Hey, you want a little rum cake?

367
00:24:43.185 --> 00:24:44.603
- I really shouldn't.
- Have a little rum cake.

368
00:24:44.708 --> 00:24:46.751
- No, no, no, I can't.
- Come on!

369
00:24:46.835 --> 00:24:49.004
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

370
00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:51.131
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

371
00:24:51.214 --> 00:24:52.299
You look great!

372
00:24:52.382 --> 00:24:55.302
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

373
00:24:55.385 --> 00:24:56.803
Are you all right?

374
00:24:56.886 --> 00:24:58.221
No.

375
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.060
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

376
00:25:04.144 --> 00:25:06.062
So he finally gets there.

377
00:25:06.146 --> 00:25:09.816
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

378
00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:13.987
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

379
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.281
"Why would I marry a watermelon?"

380
00:25:22.078 --> 00:25:24.664
Is that a bee joke?

381
00:25:24.748 --> 00:25:26.291
That's the kind of stuff that we do.

382
00:25:26.374 --> 00:25:28.418
Yeah, different.

383
00:25:28.501 --> 00:25:31.421
So anyway, what are you gonna do, Barry?

384
00:25:31.504 --> 00:25:33.548
About work? I don't know.

385
00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:38.011
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

386
00:25:38.094 --> 00:25:39.804
I know how you feel.

387
00:25:39.888 --> 00:25:41.514
- You do?
- Sure.

388
00:25:41.598 --> 00:25:45.977
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer
or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

389
00:25:46.061 --> 00:25:48.855
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

390
00:25:48.938 --> 00:25:52.609
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

391
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.196
Anyway, you see, if you look...

392
00:25:56.279 --> 00:25:59.032
There's my hive right there. See it?

393
00:25:59.115 --> 00:26:00.784
You're in Sheep Meadow!

394
00:26:00.867 --> 00:26:03.620
Yes! You know the Turtle Pond?
I'm right off of that!

395
00:26:03.703 --> 00:26:08.541
No way! I know that area.
Do you know I lost a toe ring there once.

396
00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:11.252
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

397
00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:14.798
- I don't know. It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

398
00:26:14.881 --> 00:26:18.218
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

399
00:26:18.301 --> 00:26:20.679
Just having two cups of coffee!

400
00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:36.778
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

401
00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:38.154
Yeah, it's no trouble.

402
00:26:38.238 --> 00:26:42.075
Sorry I couldn't finish it.
If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.

403
00:26:42.617 --> 00:26:43.827
Are you...

404
00:26:45.662 --> 00:26:47.706
Can I take a piece of this with me?

405
00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:50.333
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

406
00:26:51.835 --> 00:26:53.461
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

407
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.341
All right. Well, then,
I guess I'll see you around.

408
00:26:58.425 --> 00:26:59.926
Or not, or...

409
00:27:00.135 --> 00:27:01.761
Okay, Barry.

410
00:27:01.845 --> 00:27:04.806
And thank you
so much again, for before.

411
00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:06.850
Oh, that? That was nothing.

412
00:27:06.933 --> 00:27:09.686
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

413
00:27:30.957 --> 00:27:32.709
This can't possibly work.

414
00:27:32.792 --> 00:27:35.378
Well, he's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

415
00:27:35.462 --> 00:27:37.714
Okay, Dave, pull the chute.

416
00:27:41.134 --> 00:27:42.969
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

417
00:27:43.052 --> 00:27:45.889
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

418
00:27:45.972 --> 00:27:48.641
Humans! Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

419
00:27:48.725 --> 00:27:51.311
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

420
00:27:51.394 --> 00:27:53.563
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

421
00:27:53.646 --> 00:27:56.399
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive around real crazy.

422
00:27:56.483 --> 00:28:00.320
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

423
00:28:00.403 --> 00:28:01.946
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

424
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.700
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see out there.

425
00:28:05.784 --> 00:28:07.494
You had your "experience".

426
00:28:07.577 --> 00:28:10.663
Now you can pick out your job
and be normal.

427
00:28:10.747 --> 00:28:12.415
- Well...
- Well?

428
00:28:12.499 --> 00:28:13.666
Well, I met someone.

429
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.419
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

430
00:28:16.503 --> 00:28:19.714
- Not a wasp? Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

431
00:28:19.798 --> 00:28:21.925
- Spider?
- You know I'm not attracted to spiders.

432
00:28:22.008 --> 00:28:24.928
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

433
00:28:25.011 --> 00:28:27.180
I can't get by that face.

434
00:28:27.263 --> 00:28:29.307
So, who is she?

435
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:31.976
She's human.

436
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.520
Oh, no, no, no. That didn't happen.
You didn't do that.

437
00:28:34.573 --> 00:28:36.529
That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

438
00:28:36.606 --> 00:28:38.525
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

439
00:28:38.608 --> 00:28:41.402
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

440
00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:44.239
Oh, no! No, no, no. You're
dating a human florist!

441
00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:45.573
We're not dating.

442
00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:49.994
You're flying outside the hive,
talking to humans that attack our homes

443
00:28:50.078 --> 00:28:54.082
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

444
00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:57.877
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

445
00:28:58.067 --> 00:28:59.087
This is over!

446
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.713
Eat this.

447
00:29:00.964 --> 00:29:03.132
This is not over! What was that?

448
00:29:03.216 --> 00:29:06.010
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

449
00:29:06.094 --> 00:29:09.556
And that's not even what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

450
00:29:09.639 --> 00:29:11.558
- You know what a Cinnabon is?
- No.

451
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:15.019
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

452
00:29:15.103 --> 00:29:16.145
Sit down!

453
00:29:16.229 --> 00:29:17.939
- ...really hot!
- Listen to me!

454
00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:22.068
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

455
00:29:22.318 --> 00:29:25.572
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

456
00:29:25.655 --> 00:29:28.408
There's no yearning. Stop yearning.
Listen to me!

457
00:29:28.491 --> 00:29:32.745
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

458
00:29:32.829 --> 00:29:34.581
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

459
00:29:34.664 --> 00:29:39.043
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

460
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.006
There he is. He's in the pool.

461
00:29:43.089 --> 00:29:45.258
You know what your problem is, Barry?

462
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:46.926
I gotta start thinking bee?

463
00:29:46.943 --> 00:29:49.095
Barry, how much longer
is this going to go on?

464
00:29:49.184 --> 00:29:52.605
It's been three days!
I don't understand why you're not working?

465
00:29:52.682 --> 00:29:55.268
I've got a lot of big life decisions
I'm thinking about.

466
00:29:55.351 --> 00:29:59.933
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

467
00:30:00.006 --> 00:30:02.275
Would it kill you to just
make a little honey?

468
00:30:02.358 --> 00:30:04.986
Barry, come out from under there.
Your father's talking to you.

469
00:30:05.069 --> 00:30:06.946
Martin, would you talk to him?

470
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.698

- We're still here, Barry.
- I told you not to yell at him.

491
00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:23.022
He doesn't respond when you yell at him!

492
00:31:23.106 --> 00:31:25.358
- Then why are you yelling at me?
- Because you don't listen!

493
00:31:25.441 --> 00:31:26.943
I'm not listening to this.

494
00:31:27.026 --> 00:31:28.361
Sorry, mom, I've gotta go.

495
00:31:28.444 --> 00:31:30.822
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. I'm meeting a friend.

496
00:31:30.905 --> 00:31:33.533
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

497
00:31:33.616 --> 00:31:34.701
Bye.

498
00:31:34.784 --> 00:31:37.078
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

499
00:31:40.957 --> 00:31:44.419
So they have a huge parade
of just flowers every year in Pasadena?

500
00:31:44.794 --> 00:31:49.215
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

501
00:31:49.298 --> 00:31:53.720
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers,
crowds cheering.

502
00:31:53.803 --> 00:31:57.223
Wow, a tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

503
00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.871
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

504
00:32:01.911 --> 00:32:05.398
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

505
00:32:05.481 --> 00:32:08.234
Yeah, okay, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

506
00:32:08.317 --> 00:32:11.738
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

507
00:32:11.821 --> 00:32:13.406
You don't have anything like that?

508
00:32:13.489 --> 00:32:17.410
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

509
00:32:17.493 --> 00:32:18.828
Oh, my.

510
00:32:19.579 --> 00:32:20.913
Dumb bees!

511
00:32:20.997 --> 00:32:24.167
You must want to sting all those jerks.

512
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.336
We really try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

513
00:32:27.628 --> 00:32:30.048
So you have to watch your temper.

514
00:32:30.131 --> 00:32:33.426
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

515
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:37.430
write an angry letter and throw it out.
You work through it like any emotion:

516
00:32:37.513 --> 00:32:40.141
Anger, jealousy, lust.

517
00:32:42.018 --> 00:32:44.395
Oh, my goodness! Are you okay?

518
00:32:44.479 --> 00:32:45.688
Yeah.

519
00:32:45.772 --> 00:32:47.928
- What is wrong with you?
- It's a bug.

520
00:32:47.948 --> 00:32:52.445
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

521
00:32:52.528 --> 00:32:54.697
What was that? A Pick 'n Save circular?

522
00:32:54.781 --> 00:32:57.116
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

523
00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.079
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

524
00:33:01.162 --> 00:33:03.007
You've really got that
down to a science.

525
00:33:03.027 --> 00:33:06.473
- We have to. I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

526
00:33:06.542 --> 00:33:10.060
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

527
00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:13.633
How did this get here?
Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,

528
00:33:13.841 --> 00:33:15.885
Ray Liotta Private Select?

529
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.347
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

530
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.096
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

531
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:24.477
Why? You don't have
enough food of your own?

532
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.146
- Well, yes.
- How do you even get it?

533
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.066
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

534
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:31.984
And it's hard to make it!

535
00:33:32.068 --> 00:33:35.822
There's heating and cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

536
00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:38.116
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

537
00:33:38.199 --> 00:33:39.492
It's just honey, Barry.

538
00:33:39.575 --> 00:33:41.160
Just what?

539
00:33:41.244 --> 00:33:44.997
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

540
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:49.252
You've taken our homes, our schools,
our hospitals! This is all we have!

541
00:33:49.836 --> 00:33:52.839
And it's on sale?
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

542
00:33:52.922 --> 00:33:54.799
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!

543
00:34:01.889 --> 00:34:03.391
Hey, Hector.

544
00:34:05.685 --> 00:34:08.020
- You almost done?
- Almost.

545
00:34:10.064 --> 00:34:12.275
He is here. I sense it.

546
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:23.327
Well, I guess I'll go home now

547
00:34:23.411 --> 00:34:27.790
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

548
00:34:27.874 --> 00:34:29.709
You're busted, box boy!

549
00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:33.212
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

550
00:34:33.296 --> 00:34:36.174
I can talk. And now you're
gonna start talking!

551
00:34:36.257 --> 00:34:39.343
Where you getting all the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

552
00:34:39.427 --> 00:34:42.013
I don't know what you're talking about.
I thought we were all friends.

553
00:34:42.096 --> 00:34:44.891
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

554
00:34:45.474 --> 00:34:48.019
You're too late! It's ours now!

555
00:34:48.102 --> 00:34:50.521
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

556
00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:53.900
You, sir, are about to be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

557
00:34:53.983 --> 00:34:56.110
Where is the honey coming from?

558
00:34:57.945 --> 00:34:59.488
Tell me where!

559
00:34:59.572 --> 00:35:02.116
Honey Farms!
It comes from Honey Farms!

560
00:35:25.848 --> 00:35:26.933
Crazy person!

561
00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:05.263
Oh my, what horrible
thing has happened here?

562
00:36:05.346 --> 00:36:08.140
Look at these faces,
they never knew what hit them.

563
00:36:08.224 --> 00:36:10.977
And now they're on the road to nowhere!

564
00:36:11.894 --> 00:36:13.312
Just keep still.

565
00:36:13.396 --> 00:36:15.731
- What? You're not dead?
- Do I look dead?

566
00:36:15.815 --> 00:36:18.985
They will wipe anything that moves.
Where you headed?

567
00:36:19.068 --> 00:36:22.029
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

568
00:36:22.113 --> 00:36:26.784
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

569
00:36:26.867 --> 00:36:28.619
I'm going to Tacoma.

570
00:36:28.703 --> 00:36:30.788
- What about you?
- He really is dead.

571
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:32.123
All right.

572
00:36:32.206 --> 00:36:33.332
Uh-oh!

573
00:36:33.416 --> 00:36:35.418
- What is that?
- Oh, no!

574
00:36:35.501 --> 00:36:37.503
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

575
00:36:37.586 --> 00:36:40.214
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

576
00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:44.552
Why does everything
have to be so doggone clean?

577
00:36:44.635 --> 00:36:46.804
How much do you people need to see?

578
00:36:46.887 --> 00:36:49.932
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

579
00:36:50.016 --> 00:36:53.185
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Carl Kasell.

580
00:36:53.269 --> 00:36:55.855
But don't kill no more bugs!

581
00:36:58.024 --> 00:37:00.943
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!

582
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.142
- You hear something?
- Like what?

583
00:37:11.202 --> 00:37:13.039
Like tiny screaming.

584
00:37:13.122 --> 00:37:14.457
Turn off the radio.

585
00:37:26.218 --> 00:37:28.220
Whassup, bee boy?

586
00:37:28.304 --> 00:37:30.056
Hey, Blood.

587
00:37:30.139 --> 00:37:33.309
And it was just an endless row of honey
jars, as far as the eye could see.

588
00:37:33.392 --> 00:37:34.560
Wow!

589
00:37:34.643 --> 00:37:38.314
So I'm just assuming wherever this honey
truck goes, that's where they're getting it.

590
00:37:38.397 --> 00:37:39.815
I mean, that honey's ours.

591
00:37:39.899 --> 00:37:42.610
- Bees hang tight.
- Well, we're all jammed in there.

592
00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:43.861
It's a close community.

593
00:37:43.944 --> 00:37:47.907
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

594
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:51.494
- What if you get in trouble?
- Trouble? You a mosquito, you in trouble.

595
00:37:51.577 --> 00:37:54.997
Nobody likes us. They just all smackin'.
People see a mosquito, smack, smack!

596
00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:58.042
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet a lot of girls.

597
00:37:58.125 --> 00:38:02.380
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

598
00:38:02.463 --> 00:38:04.590
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

599
00:38:05.966 --> 00:38:08.010
You got to be kidding me!

600
00:38:08.094 --> 00:38:11.680
Mooseblood's about
to leave the building! So long, bee!

601
00:38:12.098 --> 00:38:13.766
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

602
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:17.937
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

603
00:38:34.495 --> 00:38:38.582
We throw it in some jars, slap a label
on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.

604
00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:40.167
What is this place?

605
00:38:40.251 --> 00:38:42.545
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

606
00:38:42.628 --> 00:38:44.130
They are pinheads!

607
00:38:45.506 --> 00:38:46.841
Pinhead.

608
00:38:47.508 --> 00:38:51.011
- Check out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

609
00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:52.680
The Thomas 3000!

610
00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:53.806
Smoker?

611
00:38:53.889 --> 00:38:58.310
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

612
00:39:00.146 --> 00:39:03.232
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

613
00:39:06.026 --> 00:39:08.821
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

614
00:39:08.904 --> 00:39:11.449
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

615
00:39:31.856 --> 00:39:33.358
Oh, my!

616
00:39:36.432 --> 00:39:38.601
What's going on? Are you okay?

617
00:39:38.684 --> 00:39:40.686
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

618
00:39:40.696 --> 00:39:42.036
How do all these bees get here?

619
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:44.356
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

620
00:39:44.386 --> 00:39:47.055
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

621
00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:50.863
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

622
00:39:50.946 --> 00:39:52.656
That's a drag queen!

623
00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:59.146
What is this?

624
00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:10.633
Oh, no! There's hundreds of them!

625
00:40:21.435 --> 00:40:22.728
Bee honey.

626
00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:27.191
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

627
00:40:27.608 --> 00:40:30.092
This is worse than anything
the bears have done to us!

628
00:40:30.139 --> 00:40:31.779
And I intend to do something about it.

629
00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:32.947
Oh, Barry, stop.

630
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.367
Who told you that humans
are taking our honey? That's a rumour.

631
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:38.202
Do these look like rumours?

632
00:40:38.285 --> 00:40:41.914
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

633
00:40:41.997 --> 00:40:44.208
Barry, how did you get mixed up in this?

634
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:45.793
He's been talking to humans.

635
00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.586
- What?
- Talking to humans?

636
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.548
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

637
00:40:50.631 --> 00:40:52.132
Make out? Barry!

638
00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:53.384
We do not.

639
00:40:53.467 --> 00:40:55.636
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

640
00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:56.929
The bees!

641
00:40:57.012 --> 00:41:02.012
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Man, those crazy legs kept me up all night.

642
00:41:02.078 --> 00:41:04.458
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

643
00:41:04.518 --> 00:41:08.440
This is what I want to do for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

644
00:41:08.524 --> 00:41:10.985
Dad, I remember you
coming home some night so overworked

645
00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:14.113
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

646
00:41:14.196 --> 00:41:15.739
I remember that.

647
00:41:15.823 --> 00:41:19.618
What right do they have to our hard-earned
honey? We're living on two cups a year.

648
00:41:19.642 --> 00:41:22.413
They put it in lip balm
for no reason whatsoever!

649
00:41:22.496 --> 00:41:25.082
Even if it's true, Barry
what could one bee do?

650
00:41:25.165 --> 00:41:26.917
I'm gonna sting them where it really hurts.

651
00:41:27.001 --> 00:41:28.252
In the face! The eye!

652
00:41:28.335 --> 00:41:29.545
- That would really hurt.
- No.

653
00:41:29.628 --> 00:41:31.338
Up the nose? That's a killer.

654
00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:35.908
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it really matters.

655
00:41:36.385 --> 00:41:40.973
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

656
00:41:45.811 --> 00:41:47.396
No more bee beards!

657
00:41:49.857 --> 00:41:52.276
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

658
00:41:52.359 --> 00:41:54.194
Weather with Storm Stinger.

659
00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:55.779
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

660
00:41:55.863 --> 00:41:57.865
And Jeanette Chung.

661
00:42:00.034 --> 00:42:02.786
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Chung.

662
00:42:02.816 --> 00:42:05.609
Our top story: A tri-county
bee, Barry Benson,

663
00:42:05.706 --> 00:42:09.376
is saying he intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

664
00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.712
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

665
00:42:15.007 --> 00:42:17.509
Don't forget, tomorrow
night on Bee Larry King,

666
00:42:17.593 --> 00:42:22.848
we're gonna have three former queens all right
here in our studio, discussing their new book,

667
00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:25.976
Classy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

668
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.040
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

669
00:42:28.066 --> 00:42:31.690
Did you ever think, "I'm just a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

670
00:42:31.774 --> 00:42:34.080
Larry, bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

671
00:42:34.107 --> 00:42:37.481
I mean, what about Bee Columbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

672
00:42:37.571 --> 00:42:40.200
Where I'm from,
you wouldn't think of suing humans.

673
00:42:40.267 --> 00:42:43.494
We were thinking
more like stick ball or candy stores.

674
00:42:43.583 --> 00:42:44.541
How old are you?

675
00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:48.121
I want you to know that the entire bee
community is supporting you in this case,

676
00:42:48.194 --> 00:42:50.931
which is certain to be the trial
of the bee century.

677
00:42:50.971 --> 00:42:54.338
Thank you Larry. You know, they have a
Larry King in the human world, too.

678
00:42:54.421 --> 00:42:57.057
It's a common name. Next
week on Bee Larry King...

679
00:42:57.091 --> 00:43:01.720
No, I mean he looks like you and has a show and
suspenders and different coloured dots behind him...

680
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.353
Next week on Bee Larry King...

681
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:07.726
An old guy, glasses, and there's quotes along the bottom from
the guest you're watching even though you just heard them.

682
00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:11.855
Bear Week next week! They're scary,
they're hairy and they're here live.

683
00:43:11.939 --> 00:43:16.902
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

684
00:43:18.612 --> 00:43:23.117
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

685
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.037
But it was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

686
00:43:27.121 --> 00:43:30.916
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

687
00:43:30.931 --> 00:43:34.018
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

688
00:43:34.052 --> 00:43:36.880
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

689
00:43:36.964 --> 00:43:39.633
I'm helping him sue the human race.

690
00:43:40.676 --> 00:43:42.928
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

691
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:44.221
This is Ken.

692
00:43:44.304 --> 00:43:47.474
Yeah, I remember you.
Timberland, size ten and a half.

693
00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:49.935
Vibram sole, I believe.

694
00:43:50.018 --> 00:43:51.937
Why does he talk again?

695
00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.898
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

696
00:43:54.982 --> 00:43:57.067
But it's our yoghurt night!

697
00:43:57.151 --> 00:43:58.694
Bye-bye.

698
00:43:59.319 --> 00:44:02.239
Why is yoghurt night so difficult?

699
00:44:03.323 --> 00:44:06.769
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

700
00:44:06.843 --> 00:44:09.288
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

701
00:44:10.497 --> 00:44:12.750
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

702
00:44:12.833 --> 00:44:15.043
Just one.
I try not to use the competition.

703
00:44:16.503 --> 00:44:18.380
So why are you helping me anyway?

704
00:44:18.714 --> 00:44:20.841
Bees have good qualities.

705
00:44:22.259 --> 00:44:24.272
And it feels good to take
my mind off the shop.

706
00:44:24.326 --> 00:44:25.299
I don't know why.

707
00:44:25.345 --> 00:44:28.724
But instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

708
00:44:28.807 --> 00:44:31.101
Yeah those are great, if you're three.

709
00:44:31.185 --> 00:44:32.728
And artificial flowers.

710
00:44:32.811 --> 00:44:36.774
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me, too.

711
00:44:36.857 --> 00:44:39.234
Bent stingers, the pointless pollination.

712
00:44:39.318 --> 00:44:41.445
Bees must hate those fake plastic things!

713
00:44:41.528 --> 00:44:44.072
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

714
00:44:44.156 --> 00:44:47.326
Well, maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

715
00:44:47.409 --> 00:44:50.329
- You know, Barry, this lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

716
00:44:50.412 --> 00:44:52.623
You sure you want to go through with it?

717
00:44:52.706 --> 00:44:55.584
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able to say,

718
00:44:55.667 --> 00:44:58.378
"Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

719
00:45:01.548 --> 00:45:04.510
Sarah, it's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

720
00:45:04.579 --> 00:45:09.125
where all eyes and ears in the world are anxiously
waiting, because for the first time in history,

721
00:45:09.223 --> 00:45:13.477
we're going to hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

722
00:45:18.065 --> 00:45:20.478
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

723
00:45:20.524 --> 00:45:22.575
I don't know, but it's
pretty big, isn't it?

724
00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:25.697
I can't believe how many humans
don't have to be at work during the day.

725
00:45:25.781 --> 00:45:29.910
You think these billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

726
00:45:30.744 --> 00:45:33.747
Everybody needs to stay back
behind the barricade.

727
00:45:45.467 --> 00:45:48.804
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

728
00:45:55.036 --> 00:45:58.021
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

729
00:45:58.105 --> 00:46:00.232
Hey, you boys work on this?

730
00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:06.697
All rise! The Honourable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

731
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:11.084
All right. Case number 4475,
Superior Court of New York,

732
00:46:11.118 --> 00:46:13.871
Barry Bee Benson
versus the Honey Industry

733
00:46:13.954 --> 00:46:15.873
is now in session.

734
00:46:15.956 --> 00:46:20.544
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five major food companies collectively?

735
00:46:20.627 --> 00:46:22.212
A privilege.

736
00:46:22.296 --> 00:46:28.769
Mr. Benson, you're representing
all the bees of the world?

737
00:46:38.478 --> 00:46:41.732
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Yes, Your
Honour, we're ready to proceed.

738
00:46:43.275 --> 00:46:46.904
And Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

739
00:46:49.656 --> 00:46:52.242
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

740
00:46:52.259 --> 00:46:55.412
my grandmother was a simple woman.

741
00:46:55.495 --> 00:46:59.166
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

742
00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:04.463
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

743
00:47:04.546 --> 00:47:08.425
If we were to live in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

744
00:47:08.508 --> 00:47:10.302
just think of what would it mean.

745
00:47:10.385 --> 00:47:13.764
Maybe I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

746
00:47:13.847 --> 00:47:17.142
for the elastic in my britches!

747
00:47:17.225 --> 00:47:19.102
Talking bee!

748
00:47:19.186 --> 00:47:21.647
How do we know this isn't some sort of

749
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:25.400
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

750
00:47:25.484 --> 00:47:28.320
They could be using laser beams!

751
00:47:28.403 --> 00:47:31.490
Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning!

752
00:47:31.573 --> 00:47:35.243
For all we know,
he could be on steroids!

753
00:47:37.579 --> 00:47:39.289
Mr. Benson?

754
00:47:45.045 --> 00:47:46.985
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
there's no trickery here.

755
00:47:47.018 --> 00:47:51.385
I'm just an ordinary bee. And as a
bee, honey's pretty important to me.

756
00:47:51.718 --> 00:47:54.471
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

757
00:47:54.554 --> 00:47:57.474
We make it.
And we protect it with our lives.

758
00:47:57.557 --> 00:47:59.935
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

759
00:48:00.018 --> 00:48:03.689
who think they can take whatever they want
from us 'cause we're the little guys!

760
00:48:03.772 --> 00:48:06.525
And what I'm hoping is that,
after this is all over,

761
00:48:06.608 --> 00:48:10.988
you'll see how, by taking our honey, you
not only taking away everything we have,

762
00:48:11.071 --> 00:48:12.906
but everything we are!

763
00:48:16.237 --> 00:48:19.621
Oh I wish he'd dress like
that all the time. So nice!

764
00:48:19.705 --> 00:48:21.415
Call your first witness.

765
00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:24.543
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms,

766
00:48:24.626 --> 00:48:27.629
- pretty big company you have there.
- I suppose so.

767
00:48:27.754 --> 00:48:31.299
And I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

768
00:48:31.633 --> 00:48:34.386
Yes, they provide bee keepers
for our farms.

769
00:48:34.469 --> 00:48:37.891
Bee keeper. I find that to be a very
disturbing term, I have to say.

770
00:48:37.938 --> 00:48:42.019
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

771
00:48:42.102 --> 00:48:44.021
- No.
- I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

772
00:48:44.104 --> 00:48:45.564
- No.
- No.

773
00:48:45.647 --> 00:48:49.401
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. And not only that,

774
00:48:49.484 --> 00:48:54.281
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

775
00:48:54.364 --> 00:48:56.700
Well, they're very lovable creatures.

776
00:48:56.783 --> 00:49:00.287
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-a-Bear.

777
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.705
Yeah, you mean like this?

778
00:49:05.459 --> 00:49:07.294
Bears kill bees!

779
00:49:07.961 --> 00:49:10.931
How'd you like his big hairy head crashing
through your living room?

780
00:49:10.977 --> 00:49:14.176
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

781
00:49:15.337 --> 00:49:18.055
Okay, that's enough. Take him away.

782
00:49:23.685 --> 00:49:28.106
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me, I have to say.

783
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:31.150
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called the Police.

784
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:34.071
But you've never been
a police officer of any kind, have you?

785
00:49:34.154 --> 00:49:36.448
- No, I haven't.
- No, you haven't.

786
00:49:36.531 --> 00:49:38.992
And so here we have
yet another example

787
00:49:39.076 --> 00:49:41.828
of bee culture being
casually stolen by a human

788
00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:44.331
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

789
00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:45.582
Oh, please.

790
00:49:45.665 --> 00:49:47.793
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

791
00:49:47.876 --> 00:49:50.754
Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting.

792
00:49:50.773 --> 00:49:55.133
Or should I say, Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

793
00:49:56.802 --> 00:49:59.554
That's not his real name? You idiots!

794
00:50:00.472 --> 00:50:04.101
Mr. Liotta, first, may I offer belated
congratulations on your Emmy win

795
00:50:04.184 --> 00:50:07.062
for a guest spot on ER in 2005.

796
00:50:07.145 --> 00:50:09.022
Thank you. Thank you.

797
00:50:09.689 --> 00:50:12.674
I also see from your résumé
that you're devilishly handsome

798
00:50:12.707 --> 00:50:16.113
but with a churning inner turmoil
that's always ready to blow.

799
00:50:16.404 --> 00:50:18.949
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

800
00:50:18.965 --> 00:50:22.202
Not yet it isn't. But is this what
it's come to for you, Mr. Liotta?

801
00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:24.287
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees

802
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:28.792
so you don't have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

803
00:50:28.875 --> 00:50:31.378
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

804
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:34.589
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

805
00:50:35.757 --> 00:50:39.302
Why doesn't someone just step on this
little creep, and we can all go home?

806
00:50:39.386 --> 00:50:42.055
- Order! Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

807
00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:43.640
Order! Order, I say!

808
00:50:43.723 --> 00:50:46.059
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

809
00:50:51.606 --> 00:50:54.860
I just think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

810
00:50:54.889 --> 00:50:57.237
I'm telling you, I think
the jury's on our side.

811
00:50:58.071 --> 00:51:00.615
Are we doing everything
right, you know, legally?

812
00:51:00.699 --> 00:51:01.867
I'm a florist.

813
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:05.319
Right, right. Well, here's to a great team.

814
00:51:05.352 --> 00:51:06.913
To a great team!

815
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:10.542
Well, hello.

816
00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:12.544
- Ken!
- Hello.

817
00:51:12.627 --> 00:51:14.546
I didn't think you were coming.

818
00:51:14.629 --> 00:51:19.384
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

819
00:51:19.926 --> 00:51:24.306
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

820
00:51:24.392 --> 00:51:24.892
Yeah!

821
00:51:24.931 --> 00:51:26.975
Oh, that was lucky.

822
00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:32.189
Well, there's a little left.
I could heat it up.

823
00:51:32.272 --> 00:51:34.566
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

824
00:51:38.778 --> 00:51:41.448
So, I hear you're quite a tennis player.

825
00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:45.035
I'm not much for the game myself.
I find the ball a little grabby.

826
00:51:47.287 --> 00:51:51.280
That's where I usually sit. Right there.

827
00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:56.880
Ken, Barry was looking at your résumé,
and he agreed with me

828
00:51:56.963 --> 00:52:01.218
that eating with chopsticks
isn't really a special skill.

829
00:52:01.301 --> 00:52:04.304
You think I don't see what you're doing?

830
00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:08.147
Hey look, I know how hard it is trying to find the
right job. We certainly have that in common.

831
00:52:08.808 --> 00:52:10.185
Do we?

832
00:52:10.241 --> 00:52:14.746
Well, bees have 100 percent employment of
course, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

833
00:52:14.856 --> 00:52:17.567
That's just what I was thinking
about doing.

834
00:52:17.651 --> 00:52:22.656
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

835
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.995
I'm going to go drain the old stinger.

836
00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:30.830
Yeah, you do that.

837
00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:35.919
Look at that.

838
00:52:44.678 --> 00:52:50.934
You know. You know, I've just about had it
with your little mind games.

839
00:52:51.226 --> 00:52:53.520
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

840
00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:55.272
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

841
00:52:55.355 --> 00:52:56.690
It's a lot of ads.

842
00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:58.108
Remember what Van said,

843
00:52:58.144 --> 00:53:00.360
why is your life any
more valuable than mine?

844
00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:03.571
That's funny, I just can't
seem to recall that!

845
00:53:04.698 --> 00:53:07.534
I think something stinks in here!

846
00:53:07.617 --> 00:53:09.119
I love the smell of flowers.

847
00:53:09.202 --> 00:53:12.289
Yeah? How do you like the smell of flames?

848
00:53:12.372 --> 00:53:13.415
Not as much.

849
00:53:29.226 --> 00:53:31.057
Water bug! Not taking sides!

850
00:53:32.907 --> 00:53:36.563
Ken, look at me. I'm wearing a
Chapstick hat! This is pathetic!

851
00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:38.356
I've got issues!

852
00:53:42.902 --> 00:53:45.905
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

853
00:53:45.989 --> 00:53:47.991
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

854
00:53:58.752 --> 00:54:00.253
Surf's up, dude!

855
00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:01.588
Poo water!

856
00:54:05.008 --> 00:54:06.676
That bowl is gnarly.

857
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.180
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

858
00:54:10.296 --> 00:54:12.532
Kenneth! What are you doing?

859
00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:16.186
You know what, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

860
00:54:16.269 --> 00:54:18.271
We need to talk!

861
00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:20.190
He's just a little bee!

862
00:54:20.273 --> 00:54:25.195
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

863
00:54:25.278 --> 00:54:30.325
Long time? What are you talking about?
Are there other bugs in your life?

864
00:54:30.408 --> 00:54:33.745
No, but there are other things
bugging me in life.

865
00:54:33.828 --> 00:54:35.538
And you're one of them!

866
00:54:35.622 --> 00:54:38.750
Fine! Talking bees, no yoghurt night...

867
00:54:38.833 --> 00:54:42.962
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

868
00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:44.798
Goodbye, Ken.

869
00:54:48.468 --> 00:54:50.220
And for your information,

870
00:54:50.303 --> 00:54:55.941
I prefer sugar-free,
artificial sweeteners made by man!

871
00:54:56.476 --> 00:54:58.895
I'm sorry about all that.

872
00:54:58.978 --> 00:55:02.649
I know it's got an after-taste! I like it!

873
00:55:04.484 --> 00:55:07.437
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

874
00:55:07.475 --> 00:55:10.103
I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well.

875
00:55:10.124 --> 00:55:12.242
Are you gonna be okay
for the trial tomorrow?

876
00:55:12.325 --> 00:55:15.787
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

877
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:19.833
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

878
00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.251
Now that's a good idea!

879
00:55:21.334 --> 00:55:24.629
You can really see why he's considered
one of the very best lawyers...

880
00:55:24.712 --> 00:55:25.380
Yeah.

881
00:55:28.216 --> 00:55:30.552
Layton, you've gotta weave some magic
with this jury,

882
00:55:30.635 --> 00:55:32.595
or it's gonna be all over.

883
00:55:32.679 --> 00:55:37.016
Don't worry, Mr. Gamble. The only thing
I have to do to turn this jury around

884
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.812
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

885
00:55:40.895 --> 00:55:43.356
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

886
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.276
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

887
00:55:46.359 --> 00:55:51.114
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

888
00:55:51.197 --> 00:55:56.411
What exactly is your relationship
to that woman?

889
00:55:58.037 --> 00:55:58.997
We're friends.

890
00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.373
- Good friends?
- Yes.

891
00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:03.626
How good? Do you live together?

892
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:05.170
Wait a minute. This isn't about...

893
00:56:05.253 --> 00:56:06.880
Are you her little

894
00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:08.965
bedbug?

895
00:56:09.424 --> 00:56:13.011
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
Now from what I understand,

896
00:56:13.094 --> 00:56:16.890
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children in the hives?

897
00:56:16.973 --> 00:56:20.018
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't even your real parents!

898
00:56:20.101 --> 00:56:21.853
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

899
00:56:21.936 --> 00:56:23.188
Hold me back!

900
00:56:23.271 --> 00:56:26.274
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

901
00:56:26.357 --> 00:56:27.734
He's denouncing bees!

902
00:56:27.817 --> 00:56:30.403
And don't y'all date your cousins?

903
00:56:30.487 --> 00:56:33.239
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

904
00:56:36.576 --> 00:56:38.244
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

905
00:56:43.416 --> 00:56:45.668
Oh, I'm hit!

906
00:56:45.752 --> 00:56:47.837
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

907
00:56:47.921 --> 00:56:49.547
Order! Order!

908
00:56:49.631 --> 00:56:52.842
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

909
00:56:52.926 --> 00:56:56.888
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

910
00:56:56.971 --> 00:56:59.432
You see?
You can't treat them like equals!

911
00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:01.434
They're striped savages!

912
00:57:01.471 --> 00:57:06.105
Stinging's the only thing they know!
It's their way!

913
00:57:06.481 --> 00:57:09.234
- Adam, stay with me.
- I... I can't feel my legs.

914
00:57:10.443 --> 00:57:14.322
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

915
00:57:14.405 --> 00:57:16.199
from my heaving buttocks?

916
00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:20.036
I will have order in my court. Order!

917
00:57:20.119 --> 00:57:21.621
Order, please!

918
00:57:23.623 --> 00:57:26.417
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

919
00:57:26.501 --> 00:57:29.003
took a pointed turn
against the bees yesterday

920
00:57:29.087 --> 00:57:32.924
when one of their legal team
stung Layton T. Montgomery.

921
00:57:47.647 --> 00:57:49.607
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

922
00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:51.442
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

923
00:57:53.987 --> 00:57:55.280
I...

924
00:57:56.114 --> 00:57:58.658
- I blew the whole case, didn't I?
- It doesn't matter.

925
00:57:58.741 --> 00:58:01.578
The important thing is you're alive.
You could have died.

926
00:58:01.661 --> 00:58:04.414
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

927
00:58:04.497 --> 00:58:09.419
They got it from the cafeteria. They got
it from downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

928
00:58:09.502 --> 00:58:12.338
Look, there's a little celery still on it.

929
00:58:13.172 --> 00:58:14.966
What was it like to sting someone?

930
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:17.427
I can't explain it. It was all...

931
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:21.014
All adrenaline and then...
And then ecstasy!

932
00:58:23.891 --> 00:58:25.310
All right.

933
00:58:25.566 --> 00:58:27.437
You think it was all a trap?

934
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.732
Of course.
I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.

935
00:58:30.815 --> 00:58:32.734
What were we thinking? Look at us.

936
00:58:32.817 --> 00:58:35.194
We're just a couple of bugs
in this world.

937
00:58:35.278 --> 00:58:37.614
What do you think the humans
will do to us if they win?

938
00:58:37.697 --> 00:58:38.948
I don't know.

939
00:58:39.032 --> 00:58:42.452
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

940
00:58:42.535 --> 00:58:46.122
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

941
00:58:46.205 --> 00:58:47.540
Oh, my.

942
00:58:50.084 --> 00:58:52.629
Say, could you get a nurse
to close that window?

943
00:58:52.712 --> 00:58:54.672
- Why?
- The smoke.

944
00:58:54.756 --> 00:58:56.957
Bees don't smoke.

945
00:58:57.008 --> 00:58:59.427
Right. Bees don't smoke.

946
00:59:00.553 --> 00:59:04.307
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

947
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:06.684
Adam, that's it! That's our case!

948
00:59:06.768 --> 00:59:08.026
It is? It's not over?

949
00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:10.647
No, get up. Get dressed.
I've gotta go somewhere.

950
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:13.733
You get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

951
00:59:16.402 --> 00:59:19.822
And assuming you've done
step 29 correctly,

952
00:59:19.906 --> 00:59:21.074
you're ready for the tub.

953
00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:28.456
Mr. Flayman.

954
00:59:28.539 --> 00:59:30.041
Yes? Yes, Your Honour!

955
00:59:30.124 --> 00:59:32.835
Where is the rest of your team?

956
00:59:32.919 --> 00:59:35.254
Well, Your Honour, it's interesting.

957
00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:38.007
You know, bees are trained
to fly kind of haphazardly,

958
00:59:38.091 --> 00:59:40.802
and as a result, quite often
we don't make very good time.

959
00:59:41.469 --> 00:59:43.680
I actually once heard a
funny story about...

960
00:59:43.763 --> 00:59:46.391
Your Honour,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

961
00:59:46.474 --> 00:59:49.143
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

962
00:59:49.227 --> 00:59:53.940
How much longer are we going to allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

963
00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:58.389
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

964
00:59:58.415 --> 01:00:02.913
against my clients, who all run
perfectly legitimate businesses.

965
01:00:03.282 --> 01:00:06.494
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

966
01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.871
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

967
01:00:08.955 --> 01:00:11.332
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

968
01:00:11.416 --> 01:00:13.668
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

969
01:00:13.751 --> 01:00:16.504
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

970
01:00:16.629 --> 01:00:19.757
Show me the smoking gun!

971
01:00:20.299 --> 01:00:23.094
Hold it, Your Honour!
You want a smoking gun?

972
01:00:23.177 --> 01:00:25.513
Here is your smoking gun.

973
01:00:28.599 --> 01:00:29.779
What is that?

974
01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.644
It's a bee smoker!

975
01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:34.731
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

976
01:00:34.814 --> 01:00:38.151
This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.

977
01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:46.534
Members of the jury, look
at what has happened

978
01:00:46.617 --> 01:00:50.788
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

979
01:00:50.872 --> 01:00:52.957
Is this what nature intended for us?

980
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.918
To be forcibly addicted
to these smoke machines

981
01:00:56.002 --> 01:00:58.421
in man-made wooden slat
work camps?

982
01:00:58.504 --> 01:01:03.217
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

983
01:01:05.845 --> 01:01:09.140
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

984
01:01:09.682 --> 01:01:13.770
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

985
01:01:13.853 --> 01:01:17.064
Free the bees! Free the bees!

986
01:01:17.148 --> 01:01:18.608
Free the bees!

987
01:01:18.691 --> 01:01:21.611
Free the bees! Free the bees!

988
01:01:21.694 --> 01:01:25.615
The court finds in favour of the bees!

989
01:01:25.698 --> 01:01:27.158
Vanessa, we won!

990
01:01:27.241 --> 01:01:30.244
Yay! I knew you could do it! High-five!

991
01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:32.330
Sorry.

992
01:01:32.413 --> 01:01:35.334
I'm okay! Vanessa, do you
know what this means?

993
01:01:35.374 --> 01:01:37.919
All the honey is finally
gonna belong to the bees.

994
01:01:38.002 --> 01:01:40.421
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

995
01:01:43.216 --> 01:01:47.804
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

996
01:01:47.887 --> 01:01:49.555
You'll regret this.

997
01:01:50.723 --> 01:01:52.809
Barry, how much honey do
you think is out there?

998
01:01:52.892 --> 01:01:54.685
All right. One at a time.

999
01:01:54.769 --> 01:01:56.479
Barry, who are you wearing?

1000
01:01:56.562 --> 01:01:59.273
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

1001
01:01:59.774 --> 01:02:02.485
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

1002
01:02:02.568 --> 01:02:06.697
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

1003
01:02:08.449 --> 01:02:12.495
Congratulations on your victory.
What are you going to demand as a settlement?

1004
01:02:12.578 --> 01:02:16.290
First, we're gonna demand a complete
shutdown of all bee work camps.

1005
01:02:18.292 --> 01:02:21.254
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

1006
01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:22.964
every last drop.

1007
01:02:23.047 --> 01:02:27.051
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

1008
01:02:27.134 --> 01:02:30.096
than a filthy, smelly, big-headed
bad-breath stink machine.

1009
01:02:30.429 --> 01:02:33.099
I believe we're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

1010
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.518
Wait for my signal.

1011
01:02:37.436 --> 01:02:38.646
Take him out.

1012
01:02:40.648 --> 01:02:43.526
He'll have a little nausea for a few hours,
then he'll be fine.

1013
01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:47.113
And we will no longer tolerate derogatory
bee-negative nicknames...

1014
01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:49.115
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

1015
01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:52.535
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

1016
01:02:52.618 --> 01:02:56.330
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

1017
01:02:58.332 --> 01:02:59.625
Can't breathe.

1018
01:03:02.128 --> 01:03:03.671
Bring it in, boys!

1019
01:03:05.464 --> 01:03:07.800
Hold it right there! Good.

1020
01:03:09.343 --> 01:03:10.761
Tap it.

1021
01:03:14.963 --> 01:03:17.560
Mr. Buzzwell,
we just passed three cups,

1022
01:03:17.643 --> 01:03:19.270
and there's gallons more coming!

1023
01:03:19.353 --> 01:03:23.232
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

1024
01:03:24.317 --> 01:03:28.529
Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!

1025
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.702
Turn your key, sir!

1026
01:03:46.339 --> 01:03:47.673
What do we do now?

1027
01:03:51.844 --> 01:03:53.512
Cannonball!

1028
01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.356
We're shutting down honey production!

1029
01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:04.607
Mission abort.

1030
01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:08.194
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

1031
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:58.703
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

1032
01:04:58.786 --> 01:04:59.745
Oh, yeah?

1033
01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.581
What's going on around here?
Where is everybody?

1034
01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:05.918
- Are they out celebrating?
- No, they're just home.

1035
01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:09.255
They don't know what to do.
They're laying out, they're sleeping in.

1036
01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:12.339
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

1037
01:05:12.366 --> 01:05:14.010
At least we got our honey back.

1038
01:05:14.026 --> 01:05:18.264
Yeah but sometimes I think, so what if the
humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

1039
01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:22.810
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be a part of making it.

1040
01:05:23.936 --> 01:05:26.897
This was my new desk.
This was my new job.

1041
01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:29.442
I wanted to do it really well. And now...

1042
01:05:30.776 --> 01:05:32.445
Now I can't.

1043
01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.958
I don't understand why they're not happy.
We have so much now.

1044
01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:48.252
I thought their lives would be better!

1045
01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:51.964
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

1046
01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:54.869
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

1047
01:05:54.936 --> 01:05:57.845
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

1048
01:05:59.847 --> 01:06:01.140
What happened here?

1049
01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:03.517
That is not the half of it.

1050
01:06:09.774 --> 01:06:11.776
Oh, no. Oh, my.

1051
01:06:12.651 --> 01:06:14.707
They're all wilting.

1052
01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.655
Doesn't look very good, does it?

1053
01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:18.074
No.

1054
01:06:18.110 --> 01:06:20.868
And whose fault do you think that is?

1055
01:06:23.496 --> 01:06:24.789
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

1056
01:06:24.872 --> 01:06:28.417
- Bees?
- Specifically, me.

1057
01:06:28.501 --> 01:06:32.671
I guess I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these other things.

1058
01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:37.760
It's not just flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

1059
01:06:37.843 --> 01:06:40.679
That's our whole SAT test right there.

1060
01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:44.308
So you take away the produce,
that affects the entire animal kingdom.

1061
01:06:44.391 --> 01:06:46.435
And then, of course...

1062
01:06:46.519 --> 01:06:48.270
The human species?

1063
01:06:50.898 --> 01:06:53.275
So if there's no more pollination,

1064
01:06:53.359 --> 01:06:55.820
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

1065
01:06:55.903 --> 01:06:59.240
I know this is also partly my fault.

1066
01:07:03.369 --> 01:07:05.496
How about a suicide pact?

1067
01:07:05.579 --> 01:07:06.997
How do we do it?

1068
01:07:07.081 --> 01:07:10.167
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- That just kills you twice.

1069
01:07:10.251 --> 01:07:11.585
Right, right.

1070
01:07:12.211 --> 01:07:16.298
Listen, Barry,
sorry, but I gotta get going.

1071
01:07:23.264 --> 01:07:25.766
I had to open my mouth and talk.

1072
01:07:28.394 --> 01:07:29.728
Vanessa?

1073
01:07:32.565 --> 01:07:35.651
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

1074
01:07:35.734 --> 01:07:38.737
To the final Tournament of Roses
parade in Pasadena.

1075
01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:42.741
They've moved it up to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

1076
01:07:42.825 --> 01:07:46.245
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

1077
01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:50.675
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

1078
01:07:50.715 --> 01:07:52.960
I know. Me neither.

1079
01:07:55.546 --> 01:07:58.674
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

1080
01:07:59.925 --> 01:08:03.262
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

1081
01:08:03.762 --> 01:08:05.264
Roses!

1082
01:08:05.931 --> 01:08:07.766
Vanessa!

1083
01:08:08.434 --> 01:08:10.060
Roses?

1084
01:08:10.144 --> 01:08:11.395
Barry?

1085
01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:14.565
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

1086
01:08:14.648 --> 01:08:17.610
Flowers, bees, pollen!

1087
01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:21.071
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

1088
01:08:21.155 --> 01:08:25.201
Maybe not.
Could you ask him to slow down?

1089
01:08:25.409 --> 01:08:26.994
Could you slow down?

1090
01:08:29.788 --> 01:08:30.504
Barry!

1091
01:08:30.551 --> 01:08:34.793
Okay, I made a huge mistake. This is a
total disaster, and it's all my fault.

1092
01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.212
Yes, it kind of is.

1093
01:08:36.295 --> 01:08:39.298
I've ruined the planet and I wanted
to help you with the flower shop.

1094
01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:40.966
Instead I've made it worse.

1095
01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.469
Actually, it's completely closed down.

1096
01:08:43.552 --> 01:08:45.227
I thought maybe you were remodelling.

1097
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:47.500
Nonetheless, I have another idea,

1098
01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:49.876
and it's greater
than all my previous great ideas combined.

1099
01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:51.685
I don't want to hear it!

1100
01:08:52.645 --> 01:08:56.607
All right, here's what I'm thinking: They
have the roses, the roses have the pollen.

1101
01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:59.902
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

1102
01:08:59.985 --> 01:09:03.429
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

1103
01:09:03.449 --> 01:09:04.782
- Bees.
- Park.

1104
01:09:04.865 --> 01:09:05.991
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

1105
01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:08.535
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

1106
01:09:09.356 --> 01:09:12.498
All right, Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, California.

1107
01:09:12.706 --> 01:09:15.709
They've got nothing but flowers,
floats and cotton candy.

1108
01:09:15.793 --> 01:09:17.086
Security will be tight.

1109
01:09:17.169 --> 01:09:18.921
I have an idea.

1110
01:09:19.004 --> 01:09:20.756
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

1111
01:09:20.839 --> 01:09:23.092
Official floral business. It's real.

1112
01:09:23.165 --> 01:09:25.636
Sorry, ma'am. That's a
nice brooch, by the way.

1113
01:09:25.719 --> 01:09:27.221
Thank you. It was a gift.

1114
01:09:28.347 --> 01:09:30.683
Then once we're inside, we
just pick the right float.

1115
01:09:32.351 --> 01:09:33.940
How about the Princess and the Pea?

1116
01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:34.347
Yeah!

1117
01:09:34.395 --> 01:09:37.314
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

1118
01:09:37.398 --> 01:09:38.691
Yes, I got it.

1119
01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.778
- Sorry I'm late. Where should I sit?
- What are you?

1120
01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:44.697
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

1121
01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.448
It's supposed to be under the mattresses.

1122
01:09:46.532 --> 01:09:49.285
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm gonna go talk to the marshal.

1123
01:09:49.368 --> 01:09:52.371
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

1124
01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:56.417
Let's see what this baby'll do.

1125
01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.920
Hey, what are you doing?

1126
01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:06.260
Then all we do is blend in with traffic,
without arousing suspicion.

1127
01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:12.308
And once we're at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

1128
01:10:12.391 --> 01:10:13.350
Stop! Security.

1129
01:10:13.434 --> 01:10:15.644
- Did you and your insect pack your own float?
- Yes.

1130
01:10:15.728 --> 01:10:18.230
- Has the float been in your possession the entire time?
- Yes.

1131
01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:20.517
Would you remove your shoes
and everything in your pockets?

1132
01:10:20.537 --> 01:10:22.985
- Can you remove your stinger, sir?
- That's part of me.

1133
01:10:23.068 --> 01:10:26.030
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

1134
01:10:32.411 --> 01:10:36.248
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

1135
01:10:37.624 --> 01:10:39.043
Can you believe how lucky we are?

1136
01:10:39.126 --> 01:10:41.211
We have just enough pollen
to do the job!

1137
01:10:41.295 --> 01:10:42.880
I think this is gonna work, Vanessa.

1138
01:10:42.963 --> 01:10:44.214
It's got to work.

1139
01:10:44.298 --> 01:10:46.717
Attention, passengers,
this is Captain Scott.

1140
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.094
I'm afraid we have a bit of bad weather
in the New York area.

1141
01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:51.889
It looks like we're gonna be
experiencing a couple of hours delay.

1142
01:10:51.972 --> 01:10:54.558
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water.

1143
01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:55.934
They'll never make it.

1144
01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:58.103
I gotta get up there and
talk to these guys.

1145
01:10:58.187 --> 01:10:59.480
Be careful.

1146
01:11:02.102 --> 01:11:04.610
Hey, can I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

1147
01:11:04.693 --> 01:11:08.655
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable ear and nose hair trimmer.

1148
01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.620
Excuse me, Captain, I'm
in a real situation here.

1149
01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:16.543
- What'd you say, Hal?
- I didn't say anything.

1150
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:18.165
Bee!

1151
01:11:18.248 --> 01:11:21.085
Don't freak out! There's a chance.
My entire species...

1152
01:11:25.672 --> 01:11:27.007
What are you doing?

1153
01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:34.973
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

1154
01:11:35.057 --> 01:11:36.183
Don't move.

1155
01:11:41.271 --> 01:11:42.356
Oh, Barry.

1156
01:11:43.357 --> 01:11:46.110
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain speakin'.

1157
01:11:46.193 --> 01:11:50.614
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

1158
01:11:50.697 --> 01:11:52.366
And please hurry!

1159
01:11:55.035 --> 01:11:56.453
What happened here?

1160
01:11:56.537 --> 01:12:00.330
I tried to talk to them, but then there was a
DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.

1161
01:12:00.348 --> 01:12:03.476
Now one's bald, one's in a boat,
and they're both unconscious!

1162
01:12:03.877 --> 01:12:05.587
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

1163
01:12:05.671 --> 01:12:07.297
No one's flying the plane!

1164
01:12:07.381 --> 01:12:11.552
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

1165
01:12:11.635 --> 01:12:14.972
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

1166
01:12:15.055 --> 01:12:16.223
Where's the pilot?

1167
01:12:16.306 --> 01:12:18.809
He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.

1168
01:12:18.892 --> 01:12:22.104
Not good. Is there anyone onboard
who has flight experience?

1169
01:12:22.187 --> 01:12:23.814
As a matter of fact, there is.

1170
01:12:23.897 --> 01:12:25.699
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

1171
01:12:25.725 --> 01:12:28.158
From the honey trial? Oh, great.

1172
01:12:28.235 --> 01:12:30.821
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

1173
01:12:30.904 --> 01:12:32.906
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

1174
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:34.223
I can't fly a plane.

1175
01:12:34.263 --> 01:12:36.827
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

1176
01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:38.620
How hard could it be?

1177
01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:42.499
Wait a minute, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

1178
01:12:45.586 --> 01:12:49.590
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

1179
01:12:49.673 --> 01:12:52.509
where a very suspenseful scene
is developing.

1180
01:12:52.593 --> 01:12:55.262
Barry Benson,
fresh off his stunning legal victory...

1181
01:12:55.345 --> 01:12:56.513
That's Barry!

1182
01:12:56.597 --> 01:13:00.058
...is now attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

1183
01:13:00.142 --> 01:13:02.352
and an incapacitated flight crew.

1184
01:13:02.436 --> 01:13:03.520
Flowers?

1185
01:13:03.604 --> 01:13:07.900
We have an electrical storm in the area and two
individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet

1186
01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:10.235
with absolutely no flight experience.

1187
01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:13.197
Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater.
There's a honey bee on that plane.

1188
01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.534
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson's work
and his no-account compadres.

1189
01:13:17.618 --> 01:13:19.218
Haven't they done enough damage already?

1190
01:13:19.286 --> 01:13:21.092
But isn't he your only hope right now?

1191
01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:24.041
Come on, technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

1192
01:13:24.124 --> 01:13:25.966
Their wings are too small,
their bodies are too big...

1193
01:13:26.019 --> 01:13:29.139
Hey, hold on a second.
Haven't we heard this a million times?

1194
01:13:29.192 --> 01:13:32.257
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass doesn't make sense."

1195
01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:34.051
- Get this on the air!
- You got it.

1196
01:13:34.134 --> 01:13:35.928
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

1197
01:13:36.014 --> 01:13:39.223
Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work
may be a mystery to you.

1198
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.185
Because making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

1199
01:13:43.268 --> 01:13:45.395
But let me tell you about a small job.

1200
01:13:45.479 --> 01:13:48.315
If you do it really well,
it makes a big difference.

1201
01:13:48.398 --> 01:13:51.318
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

1202
01:13:51.401 --> 01:13:55.239
That's why I want to get bees back to
doing what we do best, working together.

1203
01:13:55.322 --> 01:13:56.865
That's the bee way!

1204
01:13:56.949 --> 01:14:00.244
We're not made of Jell-O.
We get behind a fellow.

1205
01:14:00.327 --> 01:14:02.663
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

1206
01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:08.252
Left, right, down, hover.

1207
01:14:08.335 --> 01:14:09.363
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

1208
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:12.714
You know what? This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

1209
01:14:15.676 --> 01:14:17.427
Barry, what happened?

1210
01:14:17.511 --> 01:14:20.430
Wait a minute, I think we were
on autopilot that whole time.

1211
01:14:20.514 --> 01:14:23.137
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

1212
01:14:23.184 --> 01:14:26.228
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

1213
01:14:29.523 --> 01:14:33.944
All of you, let's get behind this fellow!
Move it out!

1214
01:14:34.361 --> 01:14:36.029
Move out!

1215
01:14:43.912 --> 01:14:45.956
Our only chance is if I do what I would do,

1216
01:14:46.039 --> 01:14:47.916
and you copy me
with the wings of the plane!

1217
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.001
Don't have to yell.

1218
01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:51.628
I'm not yelling! We happen to
be in a lot of trouble here.

1219
01:14:51.712 --> 01:14:54.988
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

1220
01:14:55.022 --> 01:14:58.218
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

1221
01:15:08.979 --> 01:15:10.188
I don't think I can do this!

1222
01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:13.817
Vanessa, pull yourself together. Listen
to me! You have got to snap out of it!

1223
01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.068
You snap out of it.

1224
01:15:15.152 --> 01:15:16.236
You snap out of it.

1225
01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.261
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1226
01:15:18.328 --> 01:15:21.248
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1227
01:15:41.178 --> 01:15:43.639
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1228
01:15:43.722 --> 01:15:46.016
- Hold it!
- Why? Come on, it's my turn.

1229
01:15:46.099 --> 01:15:48.226
How is the plane flying?

1230
01:15:48.602 --> 01:15:49.770
I don't know.

1231
01:15:50.604 --> 01:15:51.484
Hello?

1232
01:15:51.524 --> 01:15:54.775
Hey Benson, have you got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

1233
01:15:54.858 --> 01:15:56.193
The Pollen Jocks!

1234
01:15:56.276 --> 01:15:58.195
They do get behind a fellow.

1235
01:15:58.278 --> 01:15:59.863
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

1236
01:15:59.946 --> 01:16:03.200
All right you two, what do you say we
drop this tin can on the black-top.

1237
01:16:03.283 --> 01:16:06.036
What black top? Where? I
can't see anything. Can you?

1238
01:16:06.119 --> 01:16:08.372
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

1239
01:16:08.455 --> 01:16:10.874
Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.

1240
01:16:10.957 --> 01:16:12.876
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

1241
01:16:12.959 --> 01:16:16.213
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1242
01:16:16.296 --> 01:16:19.049
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

1243
01:16:19.132 --> 01:16:21.843
- What?
- I don't know but it's strong, pulling me.

1244
01:16:21.927 --> 01:16:24.221
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

1245
01:16:24.304 --> 01:16:25.639
Bring the nose of the plane down.

1246
01:16:28.558 --> 01:16:31.905
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1247
01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:36.233
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

1248
01:16:36.316 --> 01:16:40.153
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1249
01:16:40.237 --> 01:16:42.572
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- Okay.

1250
01:16:42.656 --> 01:16:44.096
- Cut the engines.
- Cut the engines?

1251
01:16:44.157 --> 01:16:46.743
We're going in on bee power.
Ready, boys?

1252
01:16:46.827 --> 01:16:47.994
Affirmative!

1253
01:16:50.831 --> 01:16:53.333
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

1254
01:16:53.417 --> 01:16:55.085
Land on that flower!

1255
01:16:55.168 --> 01:16:56.753
Ready boys? Full reverse!

1256
01:16:56.837 --> 01:16:58.004
Spin it around!

1257
01:17:01.174 --> 01:17:03.343
- Not that flower! The other flower!
- Which flower?

1258
01:17:03.427 --> 01:17:05.637
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

1259
01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:10.350
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant black and yellow pulsating flower

1260
01:17:10.434 --> 01:17:13.270
made of millions of bees!

1261
01:17:13.353 --> 01:17:16.356
Pull forward. Nose down.
Bring your tail up.

1262
01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:18.692
Rotate around it.

1263
01:17:19.192 --> 01:17:22.696
- This is insane, Barry!
- This is the only way I know how to fly.

1264
01:17:22.779 --> 01:17:26.783
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

1265
01:17:26.867 --> 01:17:30.080
Get your nose in there. Don't be
afraid of it. Smell it. Full reverse!

1266
01:17:30.107 --> 01:17:32.414
Easy. Just drop it. Be a part of it.

1267
01:17:33.039 --> 01:17:37.836
Aim for the centre!
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

1268
01:17:48.388 --> 01:17:50.056
Come on, already.

1269
01:17:54.895 --> 01:17:58.315
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

1270
01:17:58.398 --> 01:18:00.817
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

1271
01:18:00.901 --> 01:18:03.820
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

1272
01:18:03.904 --> 01:18:08.366
What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw
the flower! That was genius, man, genius!

1273
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.994
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

1274
01:18:20.086 --> 01:18:21.338
Listen, everyone!

1275
01:18:21.421 --> 01:18:23.814
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

1276
01:18:23.861 --> 01:18:27.010
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

1277
01:18:27.093 --> 01:18:29.179
That means this is our last chance.

1278
01:18:29.262 --> 01:18:34.434
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

1279
01:18:34.768 --> 01:18:38.063
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment!

1280
01:18:38.146 --> 01:18:39.773
So what do you all say?

1281
01:18:39.856 --> 01:18:44.778
Are we going to be bees, or just
Museum of Natural History key chains?

1282
01:18:44.861 --> 01:18:46.404
We're bees!

1283
01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:47.656
Keychain!

1284
01:18:47.739 --> 01:18:51.535
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

1285
01:18:51.618 --> 01:18:53.537
Hold on, Barry. Here.

1286
01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:55.121
You've earned this.

1287
01:19:01.962 --> 01:19:03.672
Yeah!

1288
01:19:06.466 --> 01:19:11.471
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect fit.
All I gotta do are the sleeves.

1289
01:19:15.559 --> 01:19:16.893
Oh, yeah.

1290
01:19:16.977 --> 01:19:18.728
That's our Barry.

01:21:07.754 --> 01:21:12.300
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

1314
01:21:12.717 --> 01:21:16.888
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

1315
01:21:18.098 --> 01:21:21.017
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

1316
01:21:21.101 --> 01:21:22.602
I had no idea.

1317
01:21:22.686 --> 01:21:24.896
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

1318
01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:28.358
Would you excuse me? My mosquito
associate here will be able to help you.

1319
01:21:28.441 --> 01:21:29.442
Sorry I'm late.

1320
01:21:29.526 --> 01:21:30.652
He's a lawyer, too?

1321
01:21:30.735 --> 01:21:35.532
Ma'am, I was already a blood-sucking
parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.

1322
01:21:35.615 --> 01:21:37.450
Have a great afternoon!

1323
01:21:37.534 --> 01:21:41.705
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order for
a wedding, and I can't get them anywhere.

1324
01:21:41.788 --> 01:21:44.020
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

1325
01:21:44.047 --> 01:21:47.043
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Can I help who's next? Who's next?

1326
01:21:47.127 --> 01:21:50.213
All right, scramble, Jocks!
