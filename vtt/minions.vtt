1
00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:26.578
Illumination!

2
00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:34.020
Mi, mi, mi!

3
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.251
Minion.

4
00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:02.767
- Freeze!
- AVL!

5
00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:07.933
Stop that lady!

6
00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:14.575
- Yeah, baby!
- Attention, all units.

7
00:01:22.058 --> 00:01:23.653
Haha,
you like that?

8
00:01:41.782 --> 00:01:45.218
Whoo, baby! The Anti-Villain League
can't catch this.

9
00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:46.996
Guess who stole the map?

10
00:01:50.932 --> 00:01:52.848
Hallelujah!

11
00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:57.896
I got this.

12
00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:00.521
Woo.

13
00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:04.526
Haha, good work.

14
00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:10.067
The map to the legendary Zodiac Stone.

15
00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:14.004
We will become the most powerful
villains in the world.

16
00:02:15.107 --> 00:02:17.044
OK, let's get a move on.

17
00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.006
We leave for Asia tonight.

18
00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.319
Okay, let's see here...

19
00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:12.502
I'm in.

20
00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:41.508
Hello beautiful.

21
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:53.469
Hehehe

22
00:03:58.454 --> 00:03:58.914
What is?

23
00:04:31.378 --> 00:04:35.306
Aha, yes!
The Zodiac Stone.

24
00:04:46.713 --> 00:04:50.141
Soon, the power of these unstoppable
beasts will be ours.

25
00:04:57.682 --> 00:04:59.396
Oh, for crying out loud!

26
00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:24.343
Hurry up!

27
00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:27.006
I got a bunch of deadly
chopskis on my tail.

28
00:05:27.775 --> 00:05:29.799
Roger that,
on the copy.

29
00:05:29.824 --> 00:05:31.331
Step on it, sister.

30
00:05:37.885 --> 00:05:39.457
Hurry up!
Come on!

31
00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:52.556
I got it.
I got the stone.

32
00:05:53.122 --> 00:05:58.630
Party's over old man.
The vicious six has a new head honcho.

33
00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:01.742
You just got played, poor sucker!

34
00:06:02.337 --> 00:06:04.960
Hold on,
I started this group.

35
00:06:04.984 --> 00:06:06.316
We're a team!

36
00:06:06.341 --> 00:06:08.178
Where's your loyalty?

37
00:06:08.203 --> 00:06:10.506
Oh please, we're villains.

38
00:06:10.531 --> 00:06:11.990
There's no such thing.

39
00:06:12.015 --> 00:06:14.609
It's time for the next generation.

40
00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:34.597
Quiet down, class.

41
00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:37.271
Quiet down, class.

42
00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:40.497
People...
People...

43
00:07:40.774 --> 00:07:44.634
So, what do you want to be
when you grow up?

44
00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:46.927
- Samantha.
- I wanna be a doctor.

45
00:07:46.952 --> 00:07:49.110
Wonderful.
Bradly.

46
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.461
I want to be a teacher.

47
00:07:50.486 --> 00:07:52.207
No, you do not.

48
00:07:52.232 --> 00:07:53.881
- Ooh! Me! Me!
- Yes?

49
00:07:53.906 --> 00:07:58.101
I want to be a fireman, who's also the
president and also drive race cars. Yeah!

50
00:07:58.126 --> 00:07:59.593
Exciting.

51
00:08:00.164 --> 00:08:02.749
And what about you, Gru?

52
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.595
Gru.

53
00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:08.714
Me, I want to be...

54
00:08:09.566 --> 00:08:12.096
a supervillain.

55
00:08:15.904 --> 00:08:16.967
Loser!

56
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.027
- Kelly!
- Daddy!

57
00:08:25.052 --> 00:08:27.407
- Brad!
- Mom!

58
00:08:27.432 --> 00:08:30.368
Gru!
Kiss ala mama!

59
00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:33.416
Oh, my favorite tiny relatives.

60
00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:35.718
He's so handsome.

61
00:08:35.743 --> 00:08:37.417
No.
Guys, come on.

62
00:08:38.422 --> 00:08:41.041
Hey, I got an image
to uphold here.

63
00:08:41.732 --> 00:08:42.632
Hey!

64
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:45.215
Okay.

65
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.302
Hey, are you guys
pumped for the movie?

66
00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:48.699
Let's go.

67
00:09:26.556 --> 00:09:28.230
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

68
00:09:36.514 --> 00:09:37.416
Oh!

69
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.284
I am a pinball wizard.

70
00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:48.047
Swish!

71
00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:56.728
Hello!

72
00:10:05.053 --> 00:10:06.741
A little more.
Come on!

73
00:10:06.765 --> 00:10:08.765
- Ugh!
- Put some of those sprinkles on there.

74
00:10:09.328 --> 00:10:11.243
I like it,
like that.

75
00:10:14.849 --> 00:10:18.571
Cheese ray! Cheese ray!
Cheese ray! Ha ha ha!

76
00:10:18.992 --> 00:10:20.576
Don't cheese me, bro.

77
00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:26.549
Thank you!

78
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.123
Mmm...

79
00:10:29.148 --> 00:10:32.416
So creamy, so delicious.

80
00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:34.876
With every calorie.

81
00:10:42.622 --> 00:10:44.693
Bills, magazines,

82
00:10:44.718 --> 00:10:47.041
S&H green stamps.

83
00:10:47.066 --> 00:10:48.066
Huh?

84
00:10:54.178 --> 00:10:55.440
Holy guacamole.

85
00:10:55.465 --> 00:10:58.052
Where can we listen?
Where can we listen?!

86
00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:08.272
Hello, Mr. Gru.

87
00:11:08.297 --> 00:11:11.277
We've received your application
to the world's best

88
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:13.951
supervillain team,

00:11:13.976 --> 00:11:16.860
A recent opening

90
00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.429
- And...
- And?

91
00:11:18.454 --> 00:11:20.411
Your interview is tomorrow at noon.

92
00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:21.244
Woo hoo!

93
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:24.499
- Dy-no-mite!
- Dynamite!

94
00:11:25.642 --> 00:11:28.608
Please go to
417 Main Street.

95
00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:32.122
The password is
"you're no good".

96
00:11:32.147 --> 00:11:34.360
"You're no good"
Mhm.

97
00:11:34.385 --> 00:11:36.302
Now, get up on the
downstroke...

98
00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:39.265
'Cause this invitation is
gonna explode, baby!

99
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.263
Explode?!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

100
00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:56.432
Very big news, mom!

101
00:11:56.456 --> 00:11:58.289
Blah!

102
00:11:58.898 --> 00:11:59.739
Mom?

103
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.350
Blah!

104
00:12:03.421 --> 00:12:05.421
- Bruh!
- Blah!

105
00:12:05.446 --> 00:12:06.421
Mom?

106
00:12:07.063 --> 00:12:09.317
- Blah!
- Blah!

107
00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:13.642
- Blah!
- Blah!

108
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:15.980
- Blah!
- Blah!

109
00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:17.870
What?!

110
00:12:17.895 --> 00:12:19.931
Mom, who is this sweaty guy?

111
00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:21.657
He's stinking up the house.

112
00:12:21.682 --> 00:12:23.458
I thought you were cooking cabbage.

113
00:12:23.483 --> 00:12:25.839
He's my new guru.

114
00:12:26.062 --> 00:12:27.483
Blah!

115
00:12:27.508 --> 00:12:28.790
Blah!

116
00:12:28.814 --> 00:12:29.508
Bluhluhluh!

117
00:12:29.533 --> 00:12:31.934
Tell your weird buddies
they better stop...

118
00:12:31.958 --> 00:12:33.715
pulling their
weight around here

119
00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.993
or I'm kicking them out.

120
00:12:35.018 --> 00:12:37.966
They are killing
my mellow vibes.

121
00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:42.506
Hey!
I heard that.

122
00:12:47.995 --> 00:12:50.582
Come on! Let's go tell
the troops, the good news.

123
00:12:52.627 --> 00:12:57.373
Gentlemen, to the basement.
AKA, our new evil lair.

124
00:13:00.974 --> 00:13:02.684
This is fantastic!

125
00:13:02.708 --> 00:13:04.958
Oh, it's such a good day, guys.

126
00:13:26.477 --> 00:13:28.384
My first evil lair.

127
00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:29.880
Goosebumps!

128
00:13:32.571 --> 00:13:35.839
Well, you gotta break a few eggs
to make an omelette.

129
00:13:35.864 --> 00:13:36.874
Am I right?

130
00:13:37.237 --> 00:13:38.708
Oh.
Great job, Ryan!

131
00:13:38.733 --> 00:13:40.787
- What?
- I said, "Great job."

132
00:13:40.812 --> 00:13:42.826
- Alright!
- Never mind.

133
00:13:43.208 --> 00:13:46.009
Adrianne! Mack!
Lookin' good!

134
00:13:52.928 --> 00:13:54.592
Joe!
How's the family?

135
00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:56.266
Hey!
Good, good.

136
00:13:56.745 --> 00:13:57.519
Okay!

137
00:13:57.543 --> 00:13:59.697
Everybody, get over here!

138
00:14:02.046 --> 00:14:03.028
Now, listen up.

139
00:14:03.053 --> 00:14:04.735
Buckle your overalls.

140
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.506
Hold on to your goggles.

141
00:14:06.531 --> 00:14:11.708
The Vicious 6 wants
to meet me tomorrow.

142
00:14:14.122 --> 00:14:16.668
Mini boss!

143
00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:18.860
Alright, alright.
I'm not mini.

144
00:14:18.885 --> 00:14:21.254
Please stop calling
me that. And also,

145
00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:23.346
they haven't accepted me yet.

146
00:14:25.942 --> 00:14:28.021
Hello, Otto.
What is it?

147
00:14:30.855 --> 00:14:32.553
Ugh!
Blah, blah, blah.

148
00:14:32.578 --> 00:14:35.153
Uh huh. Well, tha-
tha um-

149
00:14:35.177 --> 00:14:35.996
Yes, I will...

150
00:14:37.218 --> 00:14:38.218
Mhm.

151
00:14:39.313 --> 00:14:42.098
I could...
Okay, you know it would be fun?

152
00:14:42.123 --> 00:14:44.313
Let's play the quiet game.

153
00:14:44.338 --> 00:14:46.266
Oh, oh, the quiet game.
Yes, yes.

154
00:14:47.457 --> 00:14:50.631
Anyway, thanks for
the hard work today everyone.

155
00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:52.109
I gotta go get some rest.

156
00:14:52.134 --> 00:14:55.196
Tomorrow is the biggest day of my life.

157
00:14:55.981 --> 00:14:57.278
Watch out, world.

158
00:14:57.302 --> 00:14:58.957
Here comes Gru!

159
00:15:00.631 --> 00:15:01.930
Mini boss!

160
00:15:01.955 --> 00:15:04.054
I'm not...
Uhh...

161
00:15:19.258 --> 00:15:20.968
Oh, these guys are the best.

162
00:15:20.992 --> 00:15:22.396
I can't believe it.

163
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:24.857
Hello?

164
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.920
Uh, mini boss?

165
00:15:27.462 --> 00:15:29.462
Can I sleep with you?

166
00:15:30.235 --> 00:15:33.716
Yeah, I get it, but I need
a good night's sleep, so get out.

167
00:15:34.595 --> 00:15:37.084
I had a nightmare.
I can't sleep.

168
00:15:37.494 --> 00:15:39.458
Okay, fine, fine.

169
00:15:39.482 --> 00:15:42.006
Because you had a
nightmare, but just tonight.

170
00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.436
I'm not buying
the nightmare story, though.

171
00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:53.603
Sorry...

172
00:15:53.627 --> 00:15:55.663
Me too,
I also had a nightmare.

173
00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.157
Oh really, you too?

174
00:15:57.182 --> 00:15:58.966
- Mhm.
- Get in.

175
00:16:00.493 --> 00:16:01.120
Thank you.

176
00:16:01.145 --> 00:16:03.227
- Good night.
- Good night.

177
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:05.002
Yes, yes, yes.
Good night.

178
00:16:06.034 --> 00:16:07.335
Good night!

179
00:16:09.359 --> 00:16:12.226
I just want to get some sleep.

180
00:16:13.249 --> 00:16:16.351
♫ V.N.C. ♫

181
00:16:16.384 --> 00:16:17.285
Breaking news!

182
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:21.843
The Vicious 6 is ready to
rewrite the rules of villainy.

183
00:16:21.868 --> 00:16:23.676
Villains of the world!

184
00:16:23.701 --> 00:16:27.165

the clock strikes midnight

185
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:29.641
and the Chinese New Year begins,

186
00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:33.354
this bad boys' power
is gonna be unleashed.

187
00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:35.936
With the power of the Zodiac,

188
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:39.127
we're gonna take out
the Anti-Villain League.

189
00:16:40.905 --> 00:16:46.056
And The Vicious 6 will be
the most powerful villains on the planet.

190
00:16:46.081 --> 00:16:49.318
Can you dig it?

191
00:16:50.469 --> 00:16:52.508
Do I dig it?
Do I dig it?

192
00:16:52.533 --> 00:16:54.826
I don't dig it.
There's nothing to dig.

193
00:16:54.851 --> 00:16:57.095
They thought they could leave me
for dead, huh?

194
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.827
Kick me to the curb
like a piece of old meat.

195
00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.421
Oh, they got
no idea what's coming.

196
00:17:04.126 --> 00:17:05.413
Oh, I'm gonna make them suffer

197
00:17:05.438 --> 00:17:06.984
- for what they've done to me.
- Uh, Mr. Knuckles?

198
00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:08.897
- Oh, boy!
- Hey, Mr. Knuckles!

199
00:17:08.922 --> 00:17:10.007
What?!

200
00:17:10.032 --> 00:17:13.104
We uhh... just wanted to make sure
we be getting paid this week.

201
00:17:13.129 --> 00:17:14.784
What a mouth on you!

202
00:17:14.808 --> 00:17:16.564
I'm paying you with knowledge.

203
00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:17.601
You are?

204
00:17:17.625 --> 00:17:18.303
Ow!

205
00:17:18.328 --> 00:17:21.666
Lesson one,
always be prepared.

206
00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:23.809
Lesson two,

207
00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:27.198
The Belgium
Five-arm Nose-Pinch.

208
00:17:27.223 --> 00:17:29.102
And lesson three,

209
00:17:29.127 --> 00:17:31.836
The Lithuanian Haircut.

210
00:17:38.382 --> 00:17:40.960
That's worth all the money in the world.

211
00:17:40.985 --> 00:17:43.350
Hey guys, forget about it.
You're going to get paid.

212
00:17:43.375 --> 00:17:46.396
But first, we got to
get my stone back!

213
00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:50.579
♫ I see a bad Gru arising ♫

214
00:17:52.317 --> 00:17:55.467
♫ I see a villain on his way ♫

215
00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:57.121
Yee-haw!

216
00:17:57.509 --> 00:18:00.800
♫ I'm gonna inter-gru with my heroes ♫

217
00:18:02.703 --> 00:18:05.687
♫ They're gonna love me
'cause I'm the best ♫

218
00:18:08.055 --> 00:18:09.567
♫ Don't mess up tonight ♫

219
00:18:10.545 --> 00:18:12.233
♫ You're gonna join The Vicious 6 ♫

220
00:18:12.257 --> 00:18:13.021
Yeah!

221
00:18:13.257 --> 00:18:16.129
♫ Here is a bad Gru on the rise ♫

222
00:18:16.154 --> 00:18:17.026
Guys!

223
00:18:17.051 --> 00:18:19.076
We're ready...
for the interview!

224
00:18:19.101 --> 00:18:21.376
Oh, you want to come?

225
00:18:21.377 --> 00:18:22.343
- Of course.
- Yes, yes, yes.

226
00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:23.098
Yeah.

227
00:18:23.123 --> 00:18:24.634
Right, right...

228
00:18:24.658 --> 00:18:25.606
Okay...

229
00:18:26.957 --> 00:18:28.595
When you guys

230
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.148
tracked me down and

231
00:18:30.172 --> 00:18:32.306
responded to my help wanted ad.

232
00:18:33.522 --> 00:18:36.831
I was like,
"Who are these tiny tater tots?"

233
00:18:36.856 --> 00:18:39.379
"And where did they get so much denim?"

234
00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:48.994
And you're just wouldn't quit.

235
00:19:02.966 --> 00:19:04.441
Ugh!
Alright!

236
00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:06.229
I surrender.
Come on in.

237
00:19:10.244 --> 00:19:12.244
Hey, Stuart.
We're having fun in here.

238
00:19:14.022 --> 00:19:16.361
We've had some
great times since then,

239
00:19:16.386 --> 00:19:18.304
But, the thing is...

240
00:19:18.328 --> 00:19:20.847
The Vicious 6,
they're the big leagues.

241
00:19:21.234 --> 00:19:23.492
And you guys...

242
00:19:23.516 --> 00:19:24.905
are...

243
00:19:24.929 --> 00:19:26.372
great...

244
00:19:26.397 --> 00:19:27.639
And so...

245
00:19:27.663 --> 00:19:30.103
Uh, the job you did on the lair.

246
00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.365
A plus.

247
00:19:32.996 --> 00:19:33.984
It's just...

248
00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:38.611
What I was thinking is that there
are a lot of other villains in the world.

249
00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:39.573
You know?

250
00:19:41.183 --> 00:19:42.763
No!
Why?

251
00:19:42.787 --> 00:19:43.795
We're family.

252
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.016
Never mind.

253
00:19:46.041 --> 00:19:49.501
Look, I think I just need
to fly solo on this.

254
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.933
See you later, alligator.

255
00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:55.467
Come on!
Stick with Gru.

256
00:19:55.492 --> 00:19:56.942
Uh, Kevin?
Kevin!

257
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:58.756
Uh...

258
00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:00.098
Sorry, sorry,
Kevin. Uh...

259
00:20:08.344 --> 00:20:11.248
- Yes?
- You know, what's fun? Hide and seek.

260
00:20:11.272 --> 00:20:12.189
Hide and seek?

261
00:20:12.213 --> 00:20:13.272
Hide and seek!

262
00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:15.597
I love that.
I love that. Woo-hoo!

263
00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:18.105
- One, two, three.
- Let's go!

264
00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:20.882
Come on.
Hup, hup, hup.

265
00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:23.750
Wait...

266
00:20:23.775 --> 00:20:24.975
Go! Go! Go!

267
00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:32.086
Hey, I'm walkin' here!

268
00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:35.306
Wow!

269
00:20:39.193 --> 00:20:40.148
Here we go.

270
00:20:50.363 --> 00:20:51.811
Excuse me!

271
00:20:51.835 --> 00:20:52.632
Sir?

272
00:20:53.588 --> 00:20:58.747
I was just wondering
if you're no good.

273
00:20:59.641 --> 00:21:01.712
You're good. My mistake.

274
00:21:04.739 --> 00:21:05.791
Oh, sorry.

275
00:21:05.815 --> 00:21:07.040
I didn't mean to scare you.

276
00:21:07.065 --> 00:21:08.331
I was just uh...

277
00:21:08.355 --> 00:21:11.238
trying out this
new invention of mine.

278
00:21:11.263 --> 00:21:15.715
I call it "sticky fingers"
or "smart goo."

279
00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.509
I haven't quite landed on the name yet.

280
00:21:19.169 --> 00:21:20.263
Come here.

281
00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:25.909
I overheard you were looking
for something...

282
00:21:26.664 --> 00:21:27.909
Special.

283
00:21:27.934 --> 00:21:28.811
I, yes.

284
00:21:28.835 --> 00:21:32.941
I was hoping you're no good.

285
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.580
I think you'll enjoy
listening in Booth 3.

286
00:21:42.853 --> 00:21:44.060
Right this way.

287
00:21:57.276 --> 00:21:59.933
This is it. Mums the word.
Keep it down. Good luck.

288
00:21:59.958 --> 00:22:01.474
Let 'em have it, son.

289
00:22:01.983 --> 00:22:03.776
Thanks, Mr...

290
00:22:03.801 --> 00:22:05.467
Nefario.

291
00:22:05.707 --> 00:22:08.509
That's Doctor Nefario.

292
00:22:08.971 --> 00:22:10.207
Here, take this.

293
00:22:11.197 --> 00:22:14.169
If you ever get famous,
remember who gave you your first gadget.

294
00:22:15.538 --> 00:22:16.649
Okay.

295
00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:30.403
Try backwards.

296
00:22:31.997 --> 00:22:32.797
Ah.

297
00:22:35.011 --> 00:22:37.995
Welcome to The Vicious 6.

298
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.361
Wow!

299
00:22:39.386 --> 00:22:42.439
That is pretty cool.

300
00:22:52.472 --> 00:22:53.546
Hello.

301
00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:02.124
Everybody here for the interview?

302
00:23:03.383 --> 00:23:04.529
Me too.

303
00:23:05.545 --> 00:23:07.378
So what do you guys
got going on later?

304
00:23:07.403 --> 00:23:08.596
Are you up to no good?

305
00:23:08.621 --> 00:23:11.021
You're gonna get into some mischief?

306
00:23:13.831 --> 00:23:15.831
Okay.

307
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:18.280
Send the first one in.

308
00:23:18.305 --> 00:23:20.738
They're ready
to see you, Mr. Gru.

309
00:23:21.463 --> 00:23:23.439
Oh, good.
Great!

310
00:23:55.796 --> 00:23:57.772
Distinguished villains,

311
00:23:58.115 --> 00:24:00.369
My name is Gru.

312
00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:05.840
I feel like I'm talking too loud,
even though our proximity

313
00:24:05.865 --> 00:24:10.173
doesn't require this kind of volume.

314
00:24:14.172 --> 00:24:16.445
If you told me, when I was ten,

315
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:20.960
that I would have the chance to fill
the shoes of my favorite villain ever,

316
00:24:20.985 --> 00:24:22.446
Wild Knuckles.

317
00:24:22.471 --> 00:24:25.740
I would say, "You got
rocks in your head".

318
00:24:25.765 --> 00:24:30.531
But now that I'm 11 and 3/4,
it makes a lot more sense.

319
00:24:31.331 --> 00:24:33.401
All right,
who let the kid in?

320
00:24:33.426 --> 00:24:35.555
I thought,
he was a tiny man.

321
00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.059
What's wrong with you?

322
00:24:38.084 --> 00:24:42.964
You seriously think a puny
little child can be a villain?

323
00:24:42.989 --> 00:24:46.621
Umm, yes.
I, I am pretty despicable.

324
00:24:46.646 --> 00:24:48.955
You don't want to cross me.

325
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.947
Evil is for adults

326
00:24:51.972 --> 00:24:56.025
who steal powerful ancient stones
and wreak havoc.

327
00:24:57.028 --> 00:25:03.477
And not for tubby little punks
who should be at school, learning,

328
00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:05.382
taking a recess.

329
00:25:05.769 --> 00:25:06.977
Sucker gets stomped.

330
00:25:07.001 --> 00:25:08.848
Ha!
Sucky gets...

331
00:25:11.548 --> 00:25:14.016
Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

332
00:25:14.402 --> 00:25:15.579
Who's next?!

333
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:21.568
I am Wingman,
the next member of The Vicious 6.

334
00:25:21.593 --> 00:25:22.779
Behold!

335
00:25:22.803 --> 00:25:24.908
The power of flight, sir.

336
00:25:28.572 --> 00:25:30.314
Alright, joke's over.

337
00:25:30.338 --> 00:25:31.294
Showtime.

338
00:25:34.568 --> 00:25:36.560
Ugh, this is a big one!

339
00:25:40.025 --> 00:25:41.760
Yes, to the left.
That's right.

340
00:25:59.068 --> 00:26:00.786
Bring him in!
Bring him in, boys!

341
00:26:04.775 --> 00:26:06.528
He took the stone!

342
00:26:06.553 --> 00:26:08.000
I'll get him!

343
00:26:13.184 --> 00:26:15.192
Lock down the building!

344
00:26:24.856 --> 00:26:26.217
I uh... I did...

345
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:27.729
Nothing to see here.

346
00:26:27.754 --> 00:26:29.125
- Oh.
- Oh, look at you.

347
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.641
Frampton Comes Alive!
Nice choice.

348
00:26:34.253 --> 00:26:35.157
I uh...

349
00:26:35.837 --> 00:26:38.538
Just keep walking.

350
00:26:47.471 --> 00:26:49.733
Who the heck is that?
A kid?

351
00:26:53.091 --> 00:26:54.473
- Guys!
- Hello.

352
00:26:54.497 --> 00:26:55.715
Mini boss!

353
00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:57.154
What are you doing here?!

354
00:26:59.331 --> 00:27:00.992
Okay, just get on.

355
00:27:01.575 --> 00:27:02.627
Which way did he go?!

356
00:27:02.651 --> 00:27:04.003
There's that little thief!

357
00:27:04.027 --> 00:27:05.456
Go!
Go, go, go!

358
00:27:05.931 --> 00:27:06.972
Split up!

359
00:27:23.092 --> 00:27:24.662
Knock knock.
Delivery.

360
00:27:35.848 --> 00:27:37.064
Are you okay, Otto?

361
00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:38.764
The demon child!

362
00:27:39.197 --> 00:27:40.981
Otto, take the stone back to the lair.

363
00:27:41.006 --> 00:27:42.029
I'll distract them.

364
00:27:42.382 --> 00:27:43.803
Go!
Go, go, go!

365
00:27:43.827 --> 00:27:44.827
Uh, okay.

366
00:27:53.057 --> 00:27:54.200
No, not now.

367
00:27:54.224 --> 00:27:55.688
Come on,
come on!

368
00:28:15.252 --> 00:28:16.795
Yeah, baby.

369
00:28:20.062 --> 00:28:21.484
I'll handle this.

370
00:28:28.014 --> 00:28:30.514
I hope you enjoy
the rest of your short life.

371
00:28:31.328 --> 00:28:33.728
Please work.
Come on, come on, come on.

372
00:28:47.303 --> 00:28:49.310
We're coming for you,
tiny man!

373
00:28:50.651 --> 00:28:53.310
Yeah!

374
00:28:57.317 --> 00:28:58.042
Woo hoo!

375
00:28:58.073 --> 00:28:59.601
John, pump it up!

376
00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:00.799
I pump up.

377
00:29:06.284 --> 00:29:10.055
They all said the kid
couldn't be a real villain.

378
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.589
We-he-ell... This kid
just stole something

379
00:29:14.613 --> 00:29:17.878
from the worst
villains in the world.

380
00:29:19.767 --> 00:29:22.980
When I bring it back to them,
they're going to say...

381
00:29:23.582 --> 00:29:27.190
"We have made a terrible mistake."

382
00:29:27.215 --> 00:29:28.526
"Please join us."

383
00:29:28.551 --> 00:29:30.812
"Please Gru"
and I will say...

384
00:29:30.837 --> 00:29:32.150
Yes!

385
00:29:32.174 --> 00:29:36.249
I will be the newest
member of The Vicious 6.

386
00:29:37.092 --> 00:29:39.686
Now all I need is Otto.

387
00:29:39.711 --> 00:29:40.956
Where is Otto?

388
00:29:42.335 --> 00:29:45.850
No, not "Otto le komay".
He needs to come in now.

389
00:29:50.918 --> 00:29:51.918
Otto!

390
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:53.875
- Mini boss!
- There you are!

391
00:29:53.899 --> 00:29:55.113
Yeah!
Hehehe.

392
00:29:55.138 --> 00:29:56.390
Ah!
You got it?

393
00:29:56.866 --> 00:29:58.045
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

394
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.922
I made sure
to bring the rock.

395
00:30:01.053 --> 00:30:01.674
Is this...

396
00:30:01.698 --> 00:30:04.376
Are you pulling on
my legs right now?

397
00:30:04.401 --> 00:30:06.519
Otto, where's the stone?

398
00:30:06.544 --> 00:30:07.508
The stone?

399
00:30:07.532 --> 00:30:08.845
Ah, yes! The stone.

400
00:30:08.869 --> 00:30:10.166
Ooh, it's a long story.

401
00:30:39.912 --> 00:30:41.175
Bada-boom!

402
00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:58.096
Oh, la la.
I fell in love.

403
00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.108
My love!

404
00:30:59.132 --> 00:31:00.882
My love!

405
00:31:01.215 --> 00:31:05.815
I love you...

406
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.439
Oh, oh, oh,
I want that.

407
00:31:07.463 --> 00:31:08.504
Wanna trade?

408
00:31:17.534 --> 00:31:18.756
It's beautiful, no?

409
00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:25.379
Did you just trade my future?

410
00:31:25.404 --> 00:31:27.308
For a pet rock?!

411
00:31:27.467 --> 00:31:29.467
Uh, yes...

412
00:31:30.312 --> 00:31:31.618
Okay, Otto...

413
00:31:31.643 --> 00:31:33.759
Where was this birthday party?

414
00:31:33.784 --> 00:31:36.515
Uh, I remember there were
balloons like from the magazine.

415
00:31:36.539 --> 00:31:38.141
I don't exactly remember the time...

416
00:31:38.165 --> 00:31:40.945
This is unacceptable. Unacceptable!

417
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.616
I told you guys that you weren't
ready for the big leagues

418
00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:46.535
and you have proven me correct.

419
00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.725
All you do is mess everything up.

420
00:31:50.749 --> 00:31:53.118
Up?
Pump it up!

421
00:31:55.329 --> 00:31:56.527
Ugh! What?!

422
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:58.321
Turn off the music.
Ugh!

423
00:32:00.608 --> 00:32:01.876
My mom was right.

424
00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:03.874
You do not belong here.

425
00:32:03.898 --> 00:32:05.766
You're fired.

426
00:32:08.534 --> 00:32:10.598
I'm going to find that stone.

427
00:32:10.623 --> 00:32:13.078
When I get home,
you all better be gone.

428
00:32:13.102 --> 00:32:13.842
Wait, mini boss.

429
00:32:13.866 --> 00:32:14.757
It's all my fault.

430
00:32:14.781 --> 00:32:17.685
- And Otto, close your yapper!
- Oh.

431
00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:22.815
- Josh.
- Yes, yes.

432
00:32:31.288 --> 00:32:33.102
Uh, Gru.
Don't leave.

433
00:32:33.126 --> 00:32:35.177
Please!
Please!

434
00:32:36.205 --> 00:32:39.649
Kevin, no, I will be better
off on my own.

435
00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:24.689
Mini boss!

436
00:33:26.824 --> 00:33:28.224
Oh, no.

437
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.045
I'm sorry.

438
00:33:32.069 --> 00:33:34.073
I thought you'd be impressed.

439
00:33:34.098 --> 00:33:36.071
Could I just speak
to Belle Bottom?

440
00:33:36.095 --> 00:33:38.095
She'll...
Aah!

441
00:33:42.775 --> 00:33:43.911
Wild Knuckles!

442
00:33:45.573 --> 00:33:46.931
You're alive?!

443
00:33:47.402 --> 00:33:51.153
Wow, my favorite villain
is also my kidnapper.

444
00:33:51.178 --> 00:33:54.646
This could be a great opportunity
if you don't kill me.

445
00:33:54.671 --> 00:33:56.693
Shut up and give me the stone.

446
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.208
Ah, yes.
The stone.

447
00:33:59.233 --> 00:34:01.367
Here's the thing about that.

448
00:34:01.804 --> 00:34:03.049
Kind of a funny story.

449
00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:04.439
Give it to him!

450
00:34:07.851 --> 00:34:08.587
And...

451
00:34:08.612 --> 00:34:13.708
It's all going to go south very quickly.

452
00:34:16.228 --> 00:34:17.748
What the heck is this?

453
00:34:33.797 --> 00:34:35.217
Where is it, boy?

454
00:34:35.242 --> 00:34:37.417
I don't have it!
I don't have it!

455
00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:38.924
I know you're hiding
it somewhere.

456
00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:40.573
I'm not, I'm not!
I swear!

457
00:34:40.597 --> 00:34:42.030
Cross my heart and hope to die.

458
00:34:42.055 --> 00:34:43.328
Stick a needle in my eye.

459
00:34:43.353 --> 00:34:44.877
Don't actually do that though!

460
00:34:44.902 --> 00:34:46.401
Somebody bring me a phone.

461
00:34:49.579 --> 00:34:50.900
Call home!

462
00:34:50.924 --> 00:34:52.401
It's ransom time.

463
00:34:52.426 --> 00:34:53.622
No, no, no!

464
00:34:53.646 --> 00:34:56.234
My mom will probably
pay you to keep me.

465
00:34:57.462 --> 00:34:58.278
Good one.

466
00:34:58.303 --> 00:34:59.089
Call!

467
00:35:17.087 --> 00:35:18.087
Kevin!

468
00:35:19.223 --> 00:35:20.516
Listen!

469
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:21.468
The telephone.

470
00:35:21.493 --> 00:35:23.350
It's Gru!
Our Gru, come on!

471
00:35:33.271 --> 00:35:34.888
Hello,
Mini boss residence.

472
00:35:34.913 --> 00:35:35.737
Who is this?

473
00:35:35.761 --> 00:35:36.305
Kevin.

474
00:35:36.329 --> 00:35:37.618
Kevin Layminion.

475
00:35:37.643 --> 00:35:38.833
Kevin lay what?

476
00:35:38.857 --> 00:35:39.982
Layminion.

477
00:35:40.007 --> 00:35:42.041
You kidding me?
You got henchmen?

478
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.580
Well, that's the end of that.

479
00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:45.580
Mini boss?!

480
00:35:45.605 --> 00:35:46.519
Listen, you.

481
00:35:46.543 --> 00:35:48.702
Bring the stone to
me in San Francisco.

482
00:35:49.061 --> 00:35:51.692
6830 Green Street, you got it?!

483
00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:53.302
Now you got two days

484
00:35:53.327 --> 00:35:57.208
or you are never gonna see
your little boss again.

485
00:35:58.232 --> 00:35:59.585
Hello?
Hello?

486
00:35:59.609 --> 00:36:00.232
Aah!

487
00:36:00.628 --> 00:36:03.097
Someone wants the stone!

488
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:05.247
Otto, where's the stone?!

489
00:36:06.714 --> 00:36:08.850
Uh, I don't really remember much.

490
00:36:08.874 --> 00:36:12.134
Um, there was a big boy
with very big hair.

491
00:36:12.158 --> 00:36:13.864
Ah!
Ok, ok, ok.

492
00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.830
No! No!
Not his tongue!

493
00:36:18.855 --> 00:36:22.514
I don't believe that!
Tell us where the stone is!

494
00:36:22.538 --> 00:36:24.029
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Calm down.

495
00:36:24.053 --> 00:36:24.493
Otto.

496
00:36:24.517 --> 00:36:26.846
Describe the boy or
I'll break your goggles!

497
00:36:26.871 --> 00:36:28.188
Okay, okay.
Yes, yes.

498
00:36:28.212 --> 00:36:30.093
I'll describe him right,
this time.

499
00:36:30.117 --> 00:36:32.117
- His hair was big. Big, right.
- Ah. Ok, ok, ok.

500
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:35.113
That's him.
The kid.

501
00:36:35.137 --> 00:36:37.061
That's him.
That's him.

502
00:36:41.428 --> 00:36:43.367
Otto, is that the kid
you gave the stone to?

503
00:36:43.391 --> 00:36:44.271
Uh, yes, yes.

504
00:36:44.295 --> 00:36:45.562
Okay!
Go, go, go!

505
00:36:52.454 --> 00:36:54.554
Oh, ho, ho...
The stone.

506
00:36:54.578 --> 00:36:56.686
Yes, I'll ask you again.
Where is the stone?

507
00:36:56.711 --> 00:36:59.483
Gave that to my uncle.
It's more his style.

508
00:37:12.616 --> 00:37:14.307
The, the, the stone!

509
00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:16.121
Kevin!
Kevin!

510
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.891
Hey!

511
00:37:20.915 --> 00:37:22.557
Give me back the stone!

512
00:37:22.581 --> 00:37:24.581
Your uncle! Your uncle!
Where did he go?!

513
00:37:24.606 --> 00:37:26.293
Ugh! I told you.

514
00:37:26.317 --> 00:37:29.230
I don't know where he went,
you stupid Twinkies.

515
00:37:35.943 --> 00:37:37.008
Uh, okay.

516
00:37:37.032 --> 00:37:37.943
Bye.

517
00:37:37.968 --> 00:37:39.618
Thank you
and bye-bye.

518
00:37:42.872 --> 00:37:45.124
Oh!
Not cool, man.

519
00:37:48.784 --> 00:37:50.074
How are we gonna find Gru?

520
00:37:50.098 --> 00:37:51.959
Poor Gru.
Poor Gru!

521
00:37:56.835 --> 00:37:58.168
San Francisco.

522
00:37:58.193 --> 00:37:59.324
Oh!
That's where Gru is.

523
00:37:59.348 --> 00:38:00.521
In San Francisco.

524
00:38:00.546 --> 00:38:01.501
Let's go!

525
00:38:02.945 --> 00:38:05.040
But, guys.
There used to be a tricycle here.

526
00:38:05.064 --> 00:38:06.052
Shouldn't we look for Otto?

527
00:38:06.076 --> 00:38:07.790
No,
we should find Gru.

528
00:38:07.814 --> 00:38:09.275
Come on,
let's find Gru!

529
00:38:14.042 --> 00:38:15.712
Let's rock and roll!

530
00:38:15.736 --> 00:38:17.678
Time to get our stone back.

531
00:38:17.703 --> 00:38:20.170
We're coming for you,
Mr. Gru!

532
00:38:20.195 --> 00:38:21.914
Hallelujah!

533
00:38:31.827 --> 00:38:33.999
Where!
Where!

534
00:38:58.293 --> 00:39:01.348
Hello!
Uh, three tickets for San Francisco.

535
00:39:01.708 --> 00:39:03.733
San Francisco?
Okay.

536
00:39:03.757 --> 00:39:05.016
How will you be paying?

537
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.457
Uh?

538
00:39:06.482 --> 00:39:07.786
No problemo!

539
00:39:08.867 --> 00:39:10.276
Oh, great!

540
00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:13.923
You know, if you have any hairballs,
we can upgrade you to 1st class.

541
00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:15.959
Get out!

542
00:39:19.892 --> 00:39:21.277
We need to find another way.

543
00:39:22.227 --> 00:39:25.004
So, there I was.
We lost thrust in both engines

544
00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:27.093
And I had to turn back
at LaGuardia.

545
00:39:28.473 --> 00:39:30.202
Ooh, la la.

546
00:39:30.227 --> 00:39:32.113
- Hey, Dolly.
- Hi!

547
00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:41.589
Rwar!

548
00:39:46.441 --> 00:39:47.722
Okay,
let's go.

549
00:40:01.244 --> 00:40:02.332
Hello, peanut?

550
00:40:02.357 --> 00:40:03.880
Oh!
Yes, please.

551
00:40:06.562 --> 00:40:07.362
Peanut!

552
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:10.069
- Peanut!
- Uh?

553
00:40:10.093 --> 00:40:10.804
Peanut?

554
00:40:10.828 --> 00:40:12.322
- Peanut!
- Thank you.

555
00:40:12.347 --> 00:40:13.465
- Peanut?
- Thank you.

556
00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:14.983
Hey, baby!
Peanut?

557
00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:19.204
Alright, press the, the...

558
00:40:19.228 --> 00:40:20.141
- That one!
- Hey!

559
00:40:20.165 --> 00:40:22.395
- That's the right button!
- That's not right! It's wrong!

560
00:40:40.712 --> 00:40:42.467
Stuart,
stop that!

561
00:41:01.155 --> 00:41:02.410
Everything's fine.

562
00:41:14.434 --> 00:41:14.857
Ooh!

563
00:41:14.881 --> 00:41:15.794
Hello!

564
00:41:15.818 --> 00:41:17.170
Hello!

565
00:41:27.686 --> 00:41:28.686
We're here?

566
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.293
Ah!
We've arrived.

567
00:41:38.028 --> 00:41:39.509
And you see me.
You see me not.

568
00:41:39.533 --> 00:41:41.159
You see me.
You see me not.

569
00:42:00.355 --> 00:42:02.355
Woo-hoo-hoo!
Ha-ha!

570
00:42:03.319 --> 00:42:05.314
No!
No, ha-ha.

571
00:42:07.314 --> 00:42:09.287
You got real moxie, kid.

572
00:42:09.311 --> 00:42:11.003
Stealing from The Vicious 6.

573
00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:12.821
I got moxie, really?

574
00:42:13.393 --> 00:42:16.343
Did I just receive a
compliment from Wild Knuckles?

575
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:19.661
All my dreams are coming true right now.

576
00:42:19.686 --> 00:42:22.334
Well, it's about to become your nightmare.

577
00:42:22.359 --> 00:42:24.967
Welcome to my
newest torture device.

578
00:42:24.991 --> 00:42:27.399
The Disco Inferno.

579
00:42:31.556 --> 00:42:34.690
Your minions better get here
by sundown tomorrow.

580
00:42:34.715 --> 00:42:38.192
Because if 48 hours
of disco don't kill ya,

581
00:42:38.217 --> 00:42:39.966
the blade will.

582
00:42:39.991 --> 00:42:41.459
Ooh!
Oooh!

583
00:42:41.483 --> 00:42:43.132
No, no, no, no, no.

584
00:42:55.181 --> 00:43:07.453
The stone!

585
00:43:07.478 --> 00:43:08.495
- Hey!
- The stone!

586
00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:10.185
The stone!

587
00:43:10.209 --> 00:43:12.772
The stone...

588
00:43:15.162 --> 00:43:18.900
The stone. The stone.
The stone...

589
00:43:20.668 --> 00:43:21.486
Walk faster.

590
00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:22.422
Go, go, go.

591
00:43:22.446 --> 00:43:24.049
Just a few more miles.

592
00:43:24.628 --> 00:43:25.972
There!
Okay.

593
00:43:25.996 --> 00:43:29.916
Looking at the map,
once we head here, Gru...

594
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.459
Uh, should be...

595
00:43:31.484 --> 00:43:32.328
Up there!

596
00:43:35.555 --> 00:43:36.393
Alright, let's go!

597
00:43:36.417 --> 00:43:38.563
- Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup.
- My feet hurt.

598
00:43:40.366 --> 00:43:42.295
- I'm tired.
- Are we there yet?

599
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.838
Bob!

600
00:43:43.863 --> 00:43:45.398
Kevin!

601
00:43:45.423 --> 00:43:46.811
No!

602
00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.565
Hello!

603
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:51.620
Look at me!

604
00:43:57.183 --> 00:43:57.983
Hey!

605
00:44:00.066 --> 00:44:02.145
Next stop,
Green Street.

606
00:44:03.558 --> 00:44:04.758
Bye-bye.

607
00:44:08.511 --> 00:44:10.113
Hey! Hey!
You guys!

608
00:44:13.572 --> 00:44:14.627
That's the house!

609
00:44:15.104 --> 00:44:16.304
Come on!
Come on!

610
00:44:18.627 --> 00:44:20.018
Okay,
let's check it out.

611
00:44:26.683 --> 00:44:27.580
Mini boss!

612
00:44:33.913 --> 00:44:35.913
- And, I'm out.
- You're what?

613
00:44:35.937 --> 00:44:37.016
We're close to saving...

614
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.710
- Mini boss.
- No, no, and no.

615
00:44:38.734 --> 00:44:41.225
- I'm not doing it.
- Okay, Okay. Let's see...

616
00:44:42.249 --> 00:44:44.248
Oh! Look.
You're a genius.

617
00:44:49.976 --> 00:44:52.861
Listen to me,
we must be sneaky, hoo-hoo.

618
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.053
Quick!
Go, go, go.

619
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:09.813
Hey!
Go, go, go.

620
00:45:10.883 --> 00:45:11.883
Quickly hide.

621
00:45:13.592 --> 00:45:14.846
Hey...

622
00:45:14.871 --> 00:45:16.411
Wait a minute.

623
00:45:17.879 --> 00:45:18.779
Hello.

624
00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:20.696
Oh, no!
Bob!

625
00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.820
Would you like a flower?

626
00:45:26.412 --> 00:45:27.813
Trespassers!

627
00:45:28.134 --> 00:45:28.658
Get 'em!

628
00:45:28.683 --> 00:45:30.300
Hey, yo!
Come back here!

629
00:45:33.488 --> 00:45:34.288
Go, go.

630
00:45:44.184 --> 00:45:46.033
Kevin!
Oh, okay.

631
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:55.470
In there!
In there!

632
00:46:05.206 --> 00:46:06.712
Get your little butts back here!

633
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:14.611
OK, now.

634
00:46:14.635 --> 00:46:17.004
You might feel a little pinch.

635
00:46:23.258 --> 00:46:24.265
Oh, no!

636
00:46:24.298 --> 00:46:25.552
Got you now.

637
00:46:25.577 --> 00:46:27.988
Time to break some bones.

638
00:46:35.637 --> 00:46:37.270
Any plans for the weekend?

639
00:46:40.616 --> 00:46:41.676
Help us!

640
00:46:43.411 --> 00:46:46.385
Take five deep breaths.

641
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.009
I'll be right back.

642
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:50.688
Hey!

643
00:46:50.713 --> 00:46:53.052
You like picking
on little guys, huh?

644
00:46:53.077 --> 00:46:54.560
Go take a nap, old lady.

645
00:46:55.949 --> 00:46:57.310
Old lady?

646
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:10.590
I am a master of the ancient
Shaolin Art of Kung Fu.

647
00:47:23.804 --> 00:47:24.219
Huh?

648
00:47:42.886 --> 00:47:44.062
Get lost!

649
00:47:49.432 --> 00:47:51.907
You come back to our place,
you're dead.

650
00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:53.142
Uh, come on!

651
00:47:53.166 --> 00:47:54.582
The lady knows Kung Fu.

652
00:47:57.985 --> 00:47:59.908
Ah, thank you.
Thank you very much.

653
00:47:59.932 --> 00:48:01.035
We wanted to ask you...

654
00:48:01.059 --> 00:48:01.833
Shh shh shh...

655
00:48:01.858 --> 00:48:04.691
You can thank me by going away.

656
00:48:04.716 --> 00:48:05.969
I'm working.

657
00:48:05.994 --> 00:48:08.263
But, can you teach us Kung Fu?

658
00:48:08.815 --> 00:48:10.902
You? Want to learn Kung Fu?

659
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:13.321
Ah, Kevin.

660
00:48:13.322 --> 00:48:14.605
Watch and learn.
Move.

661
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:15.723
Hey, girl.

662
00:48:15.747 --> 00:48:18.496
Would you teach us
Kung Fu for smoochy-smoochy.

663
00:48:25.639 --> 00:48:27.572
My teaching days are over.

664
00:48:27.597 --> 00:48:29.780
This is my life now.

665
00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.937
Teach us Kung Fu,
so we can save the mini boss.

666
00:48:37.962 --> 00:48:39.724
Per...
Per favor.

667
00:48:48.569 --> 00:48:49.344
Fine.

668
00:48:49.787 --> 00:48:51.110
I will teach you.

669
00:48:55.513 --> 00:48:56.063
Hey,

670
00:48:57.172 --> 00:48:58.998
- those are not for you.
- I know. I know.

671
00:48:59.023 --> 00:49:02.331
The name of the game
is sell, sell, sell.

672
00:49:27.587 --> 00:49:28.910
Where's Gru?

673
00:49:29.509 --> 00:49:30.805
How should I know?

674
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:32.166
What's with the costumes?

675
00:49:32.191 --> 00:49:35.048
Halloween was four months ago.
You look stupid.

676
00:49:35.251 --> 00:49:36.947
Buzz off. Shoo.

677
00:49:37.242 --> 00:49:39.573
I'm getting my meat tenderizer.

678
00:49:39.598 --> 00:49:41.385
Let me help you with that, dearie.

679
00:49:41.644 --> 00:49:44.337
- Uh-uh, don't touch me.
- Now, where's the boy?

680
00:49:45.577 --> 00:49:47.172
Please don't hurt us.

681
00:49:47.197 --> 00:49:49.007
Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.

682
00:49:49.032 --> 00:49:51.816
Don't worry,
we're not mad at him.

683
00:49:51.841 --> 00:49:53.281
We just want to...

684
00:49:54.064 --> 00:49:55.197
hire him.

685
00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:58.137
Sorry,
the mini boss is gone.

686
00:49:58.162 --> 00:49:59.459
Where is he?

687
00:49:59.484 --> 00:50:00.948
Wild Knuckles.

688
00:50:00.972 --> 00:50:02.053
San Francisco.

689
00:50:02.078 --> 00:50:04.133
Wild Knuckles? He's alive?

690
00:50:04.158 --> 00:50:06.050
And working with the kid?

691
00:50:06.051 --> 00:50:06.835
- Hmm...
- Oh!

692
00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:09.406
We're going to San Francisco.

693
00:50:09.937 --> 00:50:11.550
- Let's hit it.
- Let's go.

694
00:50:16.427 --> 00:50:19.172
You had better be paying for my roof.

695
00:50:19.473 --> 00:50:21.172
Ay-ay-ay.

696
00:50:23.456 --> 00:50:24.919
Pretty groovy, huh?

697
00:50:32.248 --> 00:50:33.911
We begin with a basic kick.

698
00:50:35.291 --> 00:50:36.209
Now, you.

699
00:50:40.408 --> 00:50:42.301
Okay...

700
00:50:42.325 --> 00:50:43.470
No kicking.

701
00:50:43.495 --> 00:50:44.889
This is a melon hammer.

702
00:50:44.913 --> 00:50:46.150
It's a weapon.

703
00:50:46.175 --> 00:50:49.002
This is Fred.
He is a dummy.

704
00:50:49.027 --> 00:50:51.653
Never underestimate a dummy.

705
00:50:51.654 --> 00:50:52.716
Heh, dummy.

706
00:50:52.741 --> 00:50:54.079
Hello, Fred!

707
00:50:54.104 --> 00:50:55.098
Now, attack!

708
00:51:03.298 --> 00:51:04.180
Woo-hoo!

709
00:51:04.205 --> 00:51:05.328
You rock!
You rock!

710
00:51:05.352 --> 00:51:06.152
Woo-hoo!

711
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:21.164
Doubt tells me,
"I cannot break this wood."

712
00:51:21.498 --> 00:51:22.067
Uh-huh.

713
00:51:22.092 --> 00:51:25.223
But doubt exists
only in the mind.

714
00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:27.511
You know what I say
to my mind.

715
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.445
Now, you.

716
00:51:42.057 --> 00:51:43.900
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

717
00:51:53.041 --> 00:51:54.626
This is clearly not working!

718
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.099
Come on!
We're leaving!

719
00:52:01.515 --> 00:52:02.415
Okay...

720
00:52:02.439 --> 00:52:05.118
Clearly, we are not
ready for philosophy.

721
00:52:05.143 --> 00:52:06.673
Let's just train.

722
00:52:22.029 --> 00:52:23.965
Woah, woah, woah.
Okay, okay, okay.

723
00:52:43.269 --> 00:52:44.173
Rest up.

724
00:52:44.198 --> 00:52:47.579
Tomorrow's going
to be even worse.

725
00:52:48.984 --> 00:52:50.269
What?
You're quitting?

726
00:52:50.294 --> 00:52:51.409
I told you.

727
00:52:51.433 --> 00:52:52.824
When I get that stone,

728
00:52:52.849 --> 00:52:54.193
We're going to be unstoppable.

729
00:52:54.218 --> 00:52:55.864
I have had enough.

730
00:52:55.889 --> 00:52:58.537
There's nothing sadder
than an aging villain.

731
00:52:58.562 --> 00:53:00.393
So long,
old man.

732
00:53:00.418 --> 00:53:02.957
Guys, come on.
We're a team.

733
00:53:12.937 --> 00:53:14.087
Hope you like it.

734
00:53:14.111 --> 00:53:15.714
Hope you, uh...

735
00:53:16.098 --> 00:53:17.862
Is this Heaven?

736
00:53:17.887 --> 00:53:19.677
I just had to fire my henchmen.

737
00:53:19.701 --> 00:53:20.605
You know why?

738
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.697
'Cause they weren't
getting the job done.

739
00:53:23.503 --> 00:53:25.675
OK, I'm just gonna untie you now because I

740
00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:26.491
I uh...

741
00:53:26.515 --> 00:53:29.294
I, I need you to do some stuff
for me around the house.

742
00:53:30.008 --> 00:53:31.464
It might be,
you know uh ...

743
00:53:31.488 --> 00:53:34.508
kind of nice to have a...
little company around here.

744
00:53:34.533 --> 00:53:36.054
Oh!
Oh, yeah.

745
00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:39.613
Two villains just
doing some chores.

746
00:53:39.638 --> 00:53:42.071
Who knows what kind of
trouble we could get into.

747
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:45.041
What's that?

748
00:53:45.066 --> 00:53:46.673
That's your evil chuckle?

749
00:53:46.697 --> 00:53:48.009
Obviously.

750
00:53:48.034 --> 00:53:49.131
Well, it stinks.

751
00:53:49.163 --> 00:53:51.520
You sound like a clown
who swallowed a kazoo.

752
00:53:51.545 --> 00:53:52.676
Really?
Well...

753
00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:56.096
You look like a wizard going
through an end of life crisis.

754
00:53:56.619 --> 00:53:58.729
Easy there,
Don Rickles.

755
00:53:58.754 --> 00:54:00.151
Who's Don Rickles?

756
00:54:11.111 --> 00:54:13.111
The stone...

757
00:54:15.555 --> 00:54:17.555
The stone...

758
00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.446
Dude!

759
00:54:25.071 --> 00:54:26.888
I thought we lost you
there for a minute.

760
00:54:26.913 --> 00:54:28.849
Hey, chill, chill.

761
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.276
Hey, you wanna
try this on, little dude?

762
00:54:35.822 --> 00:54:37.719
The stone!

763
00:54:37.744 --> 00:54:39.307
Hey, hey, hey, soul brother.

764
00:54:39.332 --> 00:54:40.371
Where you jetting off to?

765
00:54:41.324 --> 00:54:42.406
San Francisco.

766
00:54:42.431 --> 00:54:44.932
Frisco Disco!

767
00:54:44.957 --> 00:54:46.334
It's your lucky day, kid.

768
00:54:46.358 --> 00:54:47.472
I'm heading up the coast.

769
00:54:47.497 --> 00:54:48.830
I could drop you off on the way.

770
00:54:49.575 --> 00:54:51.575
Yee-haw!

771
00:54:55.955 --> 00:54:57.696
But now,
I'm with you,

772
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.755
A very cool, handsome guy
who has the stone.

773
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.988
Oh, look at that.
Let's visit.

774
00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:10.239
Hey!

775
00:55:13.961 --> 00:55:14.961
And you.

776
00:55:18.809 --> 00:55:20.437
Hey, you!
Brother!

777
00:55:36.077 --> 00:55:37.426
Start with the pool.

778
00:55:37.451 --> 00:55:39.292
This place has gotta
be spick and span.

779
00:55:39.317 --> 00:55:40.382
What are you doing?

780
00:55:40.407 --> 00:55:43.692
You look like the overcooked turkey
my mom makes on Thanksgiving.

781
00:55:46.904 --> 00:55:47.717
Oh, yeah.

782
00:55:47.741 --> 00:55:49.439
I forgot to mention,

783
00:55:49.464 --> 00:55:52.748
the pool is filled
with my pet crocodiles.

784
00:55:55.127 --> 00:55:56.607
Yeah, well, well...

785
00:55:56.631 --> 00:55:57.872
doesn't scare me.

786
00:56:00.547 --> 00:56:01.609
Be careful.

787
00:56:01.634 --> 00:56:02.749
I can't have you lose an arm

788
00:56:02.774 --> 00:56:05.517
because they need you to
change some light bulbs after this.

789
00:56:05.542 --> 00:56:06.244
Yeah.

790
00:56:06.658 --> 00:56:08.141
Let me show you
how it's done.

791
00:56:10.407 --> 00:56:11.629
Betsy,
knock it off!

792
00:56:13.747 --> 00:56:15.039
Hey!
Whoa!

793
00:56:15.063 --> 00:56:15.923
Oh,
oh, no.

794
00:56:19.448 --> 00:56:21.780
Marvin, no, no!
Stop that!

795
00:56:23.216 --> 00:56:24.070
Woah!

796
00:56:24.094 --> 00:56:25.395
Help!
Oh, oh, no.

797
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.347
The net.

798
00:56:28.364 --> 00:56:30.121
I got you!
I got you!

799
00:56:31.916 --> 00:56:33.110
I don't got you.

800
00:56:36.813 --> 00:56:38.082
Take my hand.

801
00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.371
I got ya.

802
00:56:51.872 --> 00:56:53.336
You could have runned.

803
00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.149
But you...
But you didn't.

804
00:56:55.174 --> 00:56:56.162
I told you.

805
00:56:56.186 --> 00:56:59.172
You are my favorite
villain in the world.

806
00:56:59.197 --> 00:57:02.935
I could not let you get
eaten by crocodiles.

807
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.318
Even though, that would have
been kinda cool to watch.

808
00:57:06.253 --> 00:57:07.162
So...

809
00:57:07.186 --> 00:57:09.362
So you want to be
a great villain, huh?

810
00:57:10.605 --> 00:57:12.794
That's all I ever wanted.

811
00:57:12.819 --> 00:57:13.660
You want, uh...

812
00:57:13.685 --> 00:57:14.883
I don't know.
You want me...

813
00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:17.676
You want me to teach you a thing or two?

814
00:57:18.303 --> 00:57:19.424
Mhmhm.

815
00:57:20.726 --> 00:57:23.985
Many fighters have asked me,

816
00:57:24.009 --> 00:57:27.517
"How did I become
a great master?"

817
00:57:27.541 --> 00:57:28.874
Oh, hey!
Look up!

818
00:57:38.937 --> 00:57:43.436
Even the smallest of us
are capable of great things.

819
00:57:43.461 --> 00:57:45.751
You just dig down deep,

820
00:57:45.775 --> 00:57:48.258
find your inner beast,

821
00:57:48.282 --> 00:57:49.063
and...

822
00:57:55.009 --> 00:57:56.128
Geshundheit...

823
00:57:56.622 --> 00:57:58.073
Now, you try.

824
00:57:59.627 --> 00:58:02.296
Aah!

825
00:58:05.661 --> 00:58:08.359
Rawr.
Rawr.

826
00:58:15.101 --> 00:58:16.749
Find your inner beast.

827
00:58:18.646 --> 00:58:19.926
Stop this kick.

828
00:58:27.085 --> 00:58:29.378
We have a lot more work to do.

829
00:58:58.962 --> 00:59:01.128
Want a bite?
Sike!

830
00:59:09.815 --> 00:59:11.211
Oh, no!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

831
00:59:21.235 --> 00:59:23.235
I'll throw a fireball.
You fall down, okay?

832
00:59:30.259 --> 00:59:31.815
Huh? Huh?
Pretty good, huh?

833
00:59:38.663 --> 00:59:41.294
Kevin, Stuart, and Bob.

834
00:59:41.318 --> 00:59:42.887
You are ready.

835
00:59:45.186 --> 00:59:46.393
Let's save the mini boss.

836
00:59:46.418 --> 00:59:47.852
No, no, no, no, no.

837
00:59:47.877 --> 00:59:51.187
Ready for your Kung Fu
junior achievement badges.

838
00:59:52.859 --> 00:59:53.728
They're dead.

839
00:59:59.437 --> 01:00:00.735
First rule of heists,

840
01:00:00.759 --> 01:00:02.369
always stay in character.

841
01:00:02.394 --> 01:00:04.222
Got it, grandpa.

842
01:00:07.788 --> 01:00:09.613
Say, do you mind
if we use the John?

843
01:00:09.645 --> 01:00:13.216
Poindexter here, can't
hold it in till we get home.

844
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.551
The Bank of Evil.

845
01:00:40.385 --> 01:00:41.978
It's showtime, kid.

846
01:00:42.437 --> 01:00:44.954
Follow my lead and
don't forget your cue.

847
01:00:46.472 --> 01:00:49.224
Hello, I uh...
I just need to cash this.

848
01:00:49.249 --> 01:00:52.258
Oh, wowie zowie!
What a big bank!

849
01:00:52.283 --> 01:00:54.914
How many
security guards are in here?

850
01:00:54.939 --> 01:00:56.329
Who's this little guy?

851
01:00:56.354 --> 01:00:57.969
Well, that's my grandson...

852
01:00:57.993 --> 01:01:02.295
who still has not learned that
children should be seen and not heard.

853
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.078
Haha, kids.

854
01:01:04.102 --> 01:01:06.257
I actually have a son of my own.

855
01:01:06.944 --> 01:01:08.506
Blegh!
He look weird.

856
01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:10.483
Oh, haha!
Don't listen to him.

857
01:01:10.508 --> 01:01:12.839
Your son is very uh...

858
01:01:12.864 --> 01:01:13.770
cute.

859
01:01:15.443 --> 01:01:16.655
Aah!

860
01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.038
Oh, no!

861
01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.624
Aah, help!
I'm seeing a white light.

862
01:01:22.648 --> 01:01:25.872
Helen, I'm coming for ya!

863
01:01:28.273 --> 01:01:31.216
Helen, I'm coming for you...

864
01:01:31.241 --> 01:01:32.527
Oh...
Help!

865
01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:35.741
Help my...
my pop-pop.

866
01:01:35.766 --> 01:01:37.794
Somebody help him.

867
01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:39.010
What?

868
01:01:39.035 --> 01:01:40.406
My grandpa!

869
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.029
We need a doctor!

870
01:01:42.054 --> 01:01:44.041
This is the big one.

871
01:01:47.725 --> 01:01:48.718
You hear that?

872
01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.472
It's the sweet sound of angels.

873
01:01:54.684 --> 01:01:55.951
Do something!

874
01:01:55.975 --> 01:01:58.180
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

875
01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:12.412
No, no, no!

876
01:02:12.443 --> 01:02:14.383
The other way,
the other way.

877
01:02:18.739 --> 01:02:20.522
All right.
Everyone stand back.

878
01:02:21.937 --> 01:02:22.429
Uh-oh...

879
01:02:22.454 --> 01:02:23.477
- Clear.
- Wait a minute, wait.

880
01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.983
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

881
01:02:29.008 --> 01:02:30.827
No, no, no.
I'm feeling better.

882
01:02:30.852 --> 01:02:31.921
- Clear!
- Turn it off!

883
01:02:33.874 --> 01:02:35.482
Maximum charge!

884
01:02:35.507 --> 01:02:36.224
Clear!

885
01:02:36.248 --> 01:02:37.234
Thank you!

886
01:02:37.259 --> 01:02:39.254
You saved my grandpa.

887
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:41.243
Did we...

888
01:02:41.267 --> 01:02:42.631
Did we do the heist?

889
01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:46.147
Grandpa say the darnest things.

890
01:02:46.881 --> 01:02:48.420
- You dropped this.
- Um...

891
01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:54.067
Look what I got!

892
01:02:54.092 --> 01:02:56.098
Hey!
Not bad!

893
01:02:56.123 --> 01:02:57.352
Not bad at all.

894
01:02:57.377 --> 01:02:59.042
We make a good team.

895
01:02:59.067 --> 01:03:00.241
We do?

896
01:03:00.266 --> 01:03:01.284
Oh, yeah.

897
01:03:01.308 --> 01:03:02.977
Hey, we got to keep at it.

898
01:03:03.002 --> 01:03:05.034
Wait'll you see what I'm
gonna teach you next.

899
01:03:05.059 --> 01:03:07.174
I cannot wait.

900
01:03:07.199 --> 01:03:09.084
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

901
01:03:31.781 --> 01:03:32.781
Open the door.

902
01:03:37.408 --> 01:03:38.302
Gru...

903
01:03:38.326 --> 01:03:39.630
Mini boss...

904
01:03:39.655 --> 01:03:40.903
Okay.
Stuart, over there.

905
01:03:40.928 --> 01:03:41.821
Bob, there.

906
01:03:43.045 --> 01:03:44.334
Time to strike.

907
01:03:48.167 --> 01:03:50.613
- Mini boss! Where are you?
- Hello!

908
01:04:15.962 --> 01:04:17.387
They're not here.

909
01:04:17.412 --> 01:04:19.039
Fan out and find them.

910
01:04:27.673 --> 01:04:28.546
Bob!
Stuart!

911
01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:30.221
They're heading
into the city, come on.

912
01:04:35.573 --> 01:04:37.821
Something big is going
down in Frisco.

913
01:04:37.845 --> 01:04:40.210
Oh, look up!
Ooh!

914
01:04:40.591 --> 01:04:41.613
Beautiful.

915
01:04:46.901 --> 01:04:49.259
- Whoo! There it is.
- Woah!

916
01:04:49.433 --> 01:04:51.298
I can't believe we're finally here.

917
01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:55.156
It's been one heck
of a ride, little man.

918
01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.775
Awh, dude!

919
01:04:57.932 --> 01:04:59.478
You know, I'm gonna miss you.

920
01:04:59.503 --> 01:05:01.362
I'm here for Mini boss,
so I guess this is goodbye.

921
01:05:01.387 --> 01:05:02.808
Hey, soul brother!

922
01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:03.563
Good luck!

923
01:05:03.588 --> 01:05:04.904
Nice meeting you!

924
01:05:26.757 --> 01:05:27.650
My friend...

925
01:05:27.674 --> 01:05:30.003
You're now gonna
learn from the old school.

926
01:05:30.576 --> 01:05:31.408
What?

927
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:37.963
Oh no...

928
01:05:55.026 --> 01:05:57.669
I can't believe they...
did this to me!

929
01:05:58.327 --> 01:05:58.922
I...

930
01:05:58.947 --> 01:06:00.751
I taught them
everything they know.

931
01:06:01.308 --> 01:06:02.882
We were a team.

932
01:06:03.883 --> 01:06:05.230
Oh...

933
01:06:05.255 --> 01:06:06.485
I give up.

934
01:06:09.427 --> 01:06:10.306
Hey.

935
01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:12.330
You are a great bad guy.

936
01:06:12.839 --> 01:06:14.593
And they are stupid idiots.

937
01:06:15.268 --> 01:06:19.351
Only dream I ever had was
doing bad stuff with my buddies.

938
01:06:20.073 --> 01:06:22.307
Now, look at me.
I'm old...

939
01:06:22.331 --> 01:06:23.644
alone...

940
01:06:23.669 --> 01:06:24.950
Well...

941
01:06:24.974 --> 01:06:26.551
You are old.

942
01:06:26.576 --> 01:06:28.233
But you're not alone.

943
01:06:31.364 --> 01:06:32.574
Alright.

944
01:06:32.598 --> 01:06:33.964
Listen up, buster.

945
01:06:34.598 --> 01:06:36.920
We are starting a new team

946
01:06:36.944 --> 01:06:38.373
and it's going to be called

947
01:06:38.398 --> 01:06:39.961
The Terrible Twos.

948
01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:42.841
We can find
a better name later.

949
01:06:42.866 --> 01:06:46.275
But right now, we
are going to find that stone

950
01:06:46.307 --> 01:06:49.090
and show everybody
that you still got it.

951
01:06:49.667 --> 01:06:52.237
Come on, you're
just a little kid.

952
01:06:52.261 --> 01:06:53.764
It's over.

953
01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:54.892
Go home.

954
01:06:54.917 --> 01:06:57.085
- But you said we...
- Go home!

955
01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:46.187
Otto?

956
01:07:52.543 --> 01:07:54.543
- Yee-haw!
- Otto!

957
01:07:58.464 --> 01:08:00.964
Otto!
Mini boss!

958
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.892
Oh!
Mini boss!

959
01:08:02.916 --> 01:08:04.988
Hey!
Hahaha.

960
01:08:06.448 --> 01:08:07.448
Otto!

961
01:08:13.482 --> 01:08:14.863
You found the stone?!

962
01:08:14.888 --> 01:08:17.031
Otto, I'm so proud of you!

963
01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.659
Alright, we don't
have much time.

964
01:08:20.684 --> 01:08:22.950
- We got to get this to Wild Knuckles.
- Oh, okay! Okay!

965
01:08:24.156 --> 01:08:25.156
Get him!

966
01:08:31.502 --> 01:08:32.502
Go, go, go!

967
01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:38.535
Long time no see, punk.

968
01:08:41.155 --> 01:08:42.393
I'll take that.

969
01:08:47.297 --> 01:08:48.297
Yes!

970
01:08:49.687 --> 01:08:51.080
- Don't move!
- Hold it right there!

971
01:08:51.104 --> 01:08:52.322
- Get on the ground!
- Freeze!

972
01:08:52.347 --> 01:08:53.770
Anti-Villain League.

973
01:08:53.794 --> 01:08:55.765
You are under arrest.

974
01:08:57.122 --> 01:08:58.122
The police.

975
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:03.094
Woah, woah, woah,
everybody...

976
01:09:03.118 --> 01:09:05.303
Did you forget what time it is?

977
01:09:19.226 --> 01:09:21.555
Happy New Year!

978
01:09:26.706 --> 01:09:27.756
Fire!

979
01:09:47.837 --> 01:09:49.617
I don't believe it!

980
01:09:49.642 --> 01:09:51.063
Stand your ground.

981
01:09:52.983 --> 01:09:53.773
- Look out!
- Woah!

982
01:09:53.798 --> 01:09:54.784
Be careful!

983
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:00.600
I'm outta here!

984
01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:05.917
Oh!

985
01:10:05.942 --> 01:10:08.815
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, NO!

986
01:10:10.097 --> 01:10:12.357
Where do you think
you're going? Hmm?

987
01:10:12.382 --> 01:10:16.476
You stole from us,
and now you're gonna pay.

988
01:10:20.864 --> 01:10:22.427
Run faster!

989
01:10:22.746 --> 01:10:25.355
Enjoy being torn apart.

990
01:10:25.537 --> 01:10:27.537
Hey, let go of
the mini boss.

991
01:10:28.021 --> 01:10:29.099
Guys!

992
01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:29.883
Oh...

993
01:10:29.907 --> 01:10:32.699
Why don't we make
this a fair fight?

994
01:10:39.238 --> 01:10:40.373
Look at you!

995
01:10:43.256 --> 01:10:44.008
Oh...

996
01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:46.320
You thought I was serious?

997
01:10:46.344 --> 01:10:47.281
Run!

998
01:10:51.638 --> 01:10:53.638
No!
Aah!

999
01:10:56.638 --> 01:10:58.391
Hello, traitors!

1000
01:10:59.582 --> 01:11:01.386
Remember me?

1001
01:11:02.945 --> 01:11:04.134
You!

1002
01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:05.818
You can leave me for dead,

1003
01:11:05.843 --> 01:11:08.021
You destroy everything I own,

1004
01:11:08.045 --> 01:11:11.112
but I will not let
you hurt that kid.

1005
01:11:11.144 --> 01:11:11.790
Oh...

1006
01:11:11.814 --> 01:11:13.795
So you're gonna save the kid?

1007
01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.912
Yeah, you and what army?

1008
01:11:16.858 --> 01:11:18.436
This army!

1009
01:11:18.461 --> 01:11:19.465
Okay...

1010
01:11:19.489 --> 01:11:20.865
This army.

1011
01:12:22.179 --> 01:12:24.135
Dig down deep.

1012
01:12:24.159 --> 01:12:26.742
Find your inner beast.

1013
01:13:21.283 --> 01:13:22.283
Coming!

1014
01:13:45.388 --> 01:13:46.388
Otto!

1015
01:13:46.936 --> 01:13:48.816
Hurry!
Faster!

1016
01:14:00.855 --> 01:14:01.855
Gotcha!

1017
01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:07.573
Throw it!
Go, go, go!

1018
01:14:30.834 --> 01:14:32.246
Get away from him!

1019
01:14:32.271 --> 01:14:34.065
Destroy the kid!

1020
01:14:52.252 --> 01:14:53.677
No!

1021
01:14:56.647 --> 01:15:00.488
How does it feel to be beaten
by the crappy little bug?

1022
01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:07.134
You guys were amazing!

1023
01:15:07.159 --> 01:15:10.008
The Kung Fu,
where did that come from?

1024
01:15:10.033 --> 01:15:12.580
Obviously, you guys are re-hired.

1025
01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:16.530
Check this out.

1026
01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:17.778
Look at his chin.

1027
01:15:18.198 --> 01:15:19.668
Look, it jiggles.

1028
01:15:36.855 --> 01:15:38.403
It's all yours, sir.

1029
01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.060
Where do you want it?

1030
01:15:40.085 --> 01:15:41.375
- Take that package...
- Can you feel this, sir?

1031
01:15:41.399 --> 01:15:43.781
- Right here? There we go.
- He has second, third-degree burns.

1032
01:15:43.806 --> 01:15:46.328
Oh, no.
Wild Knuckles.

1033
01:15:48.528 --> 01:15:50.764
- Gru.
- Hey,

1034
01:15:50.789 --> 01:15:53.035
You're gonna be OK, right?

1035
01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:55.206
Don't worry about me, kid.

1036
01:15:55.231 --> 01:15:57.230
I'll be fine.

1037
01:15:57.255 --> 01:15:58.476
Finally.

1038
01:15:58.501 --> 01:16:01.973
You're going away
for a long, long time.

1039
01:16:01.998 --> 01:16:04.466
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't bet on it.

1040
01:16:05.981 --> 01:16:07.267
No.

1041
01:16:07.292 --> 01:16:09.153
See you soon, kiddo.

1042
01:16:13.796 --> 01:16:14.855
Ooh, la la.

1043
01:16:44.655 --> 01:16:47.815
Wild Knuckles
was my favorite villain.

1044
01:16:49.107 --> 01:16:52.483
We didn't have
much time together,

1045
01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.721
but the time we did have...

1046
01:16:54.746 --> 01:16:57.398
I'm so grateful for

1047
01:16:57.423 --> 01:17:00.684
I've been thinking about how you
won't see me grow up

1048
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:05.046
or be there for all the
terrible things that I'm going to do.

1049
01:17:05.071 --> 01:17:06.547
Believe me,

1050
01:17:06.572 --> 01:17:09.214
they're gonna some awful things.

1051
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:21.520
But I'm going to make you proud.

1052
01:17:21.545 --> 01:17:26.442
I'm going to be the best villain
ever because of you.

1053
01:17:26.905 --> 01:17:30.044
Because you taught
me what matters,

1054
01:17:30.068 --> 01:17:32.900
you can't do anything alone.

1055
01:17:34.445 --> 01:17:36.851
Find your tribe.

1056
01:17:36.876 --> 01:17:40.001
And never ever let them go.

1057
01:17:41.571 --> 01:17:43.720
- Otto.
- Yes.

1058
01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:30.313
You better stay out of trouble, kid.

1059
01:18:30.712 --> 01:18:34.596
I will lead a
good and honest life.

1060
01:18:37.192 --> 01:18:38.581
You're alive?!

1061
01:18:41.819 --> 01:18:43.674
You just blew my mind.

1062
01:18:43.699 --> 01:18:45.088
How did you do that?

1063
01:18:45.826 --> 01:18:50.508
I cannot wait to fake my
own death to avoid the authorities.

1064
01:18:50.533 --> 01:18:52.403
Shoot for the moon, kid.

1065
01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:53.945
Shoot for the moon.

1066
01:18:55.895 --> 01:18:58.092
See you later, suckers.

1067
01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:03.719
Wait!
Stop!

1068
01:19:04.758 --> 01:19:06.065
Wait for me!

1069
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:21.810
Sorry, we're closed.

1070
01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:26.331
I just, wanted to
thank you for this.

1071
01:19:26.355 --> 01:19:28.236
Worked like a charm.

1072
01:19:28.261 --> 01:19:30.240
Alright, let me cut
to the chase here.

1073
01:19:30.264 --> 01:19:32.493
I need a genius mad scientist.

1074
01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:34.142
You want to come work for me?

1075
01:19:34.167 --> 01:19:36.377
No, I am done with villainy,

1076
01:19:36.402 --> 01:19:38.544
off to happier horizons.

1077
01:19:39.181 --> 01:19:40.928
Goodbye, you little chap.

1078
01:19:41.531 --> 01:19:42.657
Please?

1079
01:19:51.961 --> 01:19:52.961
Cheep?

1080
01:19:53.819 --> 01:19:54.648
Ohhh...

1081
01:19:54.672 --> 01:19:56.680
All right, all right.
Fine.

1082
01:19:56.705 --> 01:19:59.021
Stop with the face.
I'm in.

1083
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.733
Wanna see something cool?

1084
01:20:09.026 --> 01:20:11.391
Oh!
Are you kidding me?

1085
01:20:19.043 --> 01:20:22.202
Big boss!

1086
01:20:22.227 --> 01:20:24.511
Big boss, I like that.
